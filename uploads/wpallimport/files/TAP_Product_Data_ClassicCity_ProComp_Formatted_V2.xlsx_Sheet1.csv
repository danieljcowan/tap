If the steering on your Jeep, truck or SUV is not as good as it used to be, 4 Wheel Parts is the place to shop.

That is, if your machine tends to pull from side to side, you may find yourself somewhere you would rather not be. The Pro Comp dual steering stabilizer helps you stay on track. This easy-to-install stabilizer immediately smooths your ride while minimizing bump steer. Made with top-quality materials, the ES2000 stabilizer improves handling characteristics and reduces wheel vibration. The result is more even and straighter steering.

If you want to add larger aftermarket wheels and tires to your rig without installing a complete suspension lift kit, Pro Comps Nitro Kits were designed with you specifically in mind.","154739,206620,206655,5367,54318,54333,54340,55758,55759,55762,56462,56463,56465,56470,56706,56708,7619,7627,7629,7634,7706,7709,7725,201402,5366,54315,54316,54332,55012,55706,55776,55780,55781,56437,56464,56466,56467,56469,56707,7623,7628,7631,7633,7700,7703,7733,7734,7744,206614,206616,206657,5365,54317,54339,55760,55775,56468,56709,7621,7624,7626,7632,7701,7704,7707,7735,7743,206618,206653,206659,206661,54273,54314,54335,54341,55761,55774,55779,56710,70881,7622,7635,7636,7702,7705,7708,7726,7732,7741,7742,7745","Bump Stops_PQ:None,Finish Color_PQ:Black,Fitment_PQ:Direct Fit,Front Lift Height_PQ:2.5 inch,Front Lift Method_PQ:Torsion Keys,Rear Lift Method (Where Applicable)_PQ:Coil Spring Spacers,Shock Relocation Bracket_PQ:Included,Spacer Material_PQ:Steel,Track Bar Drop_PQ:Does Not Include Track bar Drop,Type_PQ:Metal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's why Pro Comp also offers a lifetime warranty for as long as you own your vehicle against defects for all of our products<br><br>When you're taking tough terrain and large obstacles, your 4x4 needs to be ready to handle them. Of course, you're not going to settle for just a stock machine. Suspension upgrades are a wise move, but you need the right leveling kit to handle your vehicle's torsion bar suspension. That's where Pro Comp's leveling kits come in. As a leading maker of aftermarket lighting, wheels, tires and suspension upgrades, Pro Comp has been trusted by off-roaders for more than 25 years. Get the edge you want on the trail with a Pro Comp 2.5 inch torsion key leveling lift kit from 4 Wheel Parts.<br><br> <b>The Benefits of Leveling Kits</b><br><br> Installing a front leveling kit allows you to level out your 4x4's uneven ground stance, increasing your front end's height to equal that of the rear end. The Pro Comp 2.5 inch leveling lift kit is an inexpensive way to achieve this goal without negatively impacting your vehicle's comfort or ride quality. With the 2.5 inch kit, you gain enough clearance to add wheels and tires up to 33 inches in diameter.<br><br> <a href=""https://www.4wheelparts.com/b/suspension/leveling-kits/_/N-cm5j0"">Leveling kits</a> help you install larger tires, but they do much more for your machine than that. Add a set of high-quality aftermarket shocks and you can also achieve even better ground clearance. The amount of adjustment depends on the gear you install, of course, but these simple upgrades let you enjoy better off-road performance without sacrificing a smooth ride.<br><br> <b>Your Source for the Best Off-Roading Gear</b><br><br>","155658,155668,191167,191168,191190,193876,193887,206841,206843,210805,228390,228402,228404,241288,241296,247805,247810,247822,248106,253377,253378,253382,253428,155666,191169,193875,210804,210809,210812,228399,228401,241289,241290,241295,247813,247824,253376,253383,253430,155656,155677,191188,193874,193888,206835,210810,210813,210816,211854,228393,228398,228521,241299,241300,241301,247794,247818,247823,253380,253431,155654,155670,191189,191191,193886,193889,206834,206836,206840,206842,210803,210811,210814,228391,228392,228400,228403,233385,241287,241297,241298,241302,247793,247811,247812,253379,253381,253429","Bump Stops_PQ:None,Finish Color_PQ:Black,Fitment_PQ:Direct Fit,Front Lift Height_PQ:2.5 inch,Front Lift Method_PQ:Torsion Keys,Rear Lift Method (Where Applicable)_PQ:Front Lift Only,Shock Relocation Bracket_PQ:Longer Shocks Recommended,Spacer Material_PQ:Steel,Track Bar Drop_PQ:Does Not Include Track bar Drop,Type_PQ:Metal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suspension systems were our original foundation and they continue to be one of our strongest departments as we develop innovative new suspensions to this day.

By installing the correction brackets on lifted JL's the front control arm angles are dramatically reduced, resulting in improved ride quality and increased anti-dive. Ride quality is improved by reducing the control arm angles. By doing so, the control arm is no longer working against the coil spring and shock during the suspension cycle. The result, a smoother ride with less of a jarring feeling on rough, around town roads and small off road impacts like rocks and ledges. The new mounting positions also corrects Anti-Dive, the feeling of the front of the vehicle compressing during hard braking. By increasing the Anti-Dive the vehicle will respond more predictably in hard braking situations as well as irregular road conditions.","252387,258008,258017,258019,259828,273221,281243,281244,281249,252385,258010,258012,259827,259829,259830,259832,259833,259973,272736,273220,281240,281245,281246,281250,248676,252383,259972,273218,273223,281247,281248,281252,248677,252384,252386,258014,258016,259831,273219,273222,281239,281241,281242,281318",Fitment_PQ:Direct Fit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company's business is customer-driven, technology-influenced, engineering-oriented and focuses on world-class manufacturing processes and techniques. Led by head engineer and SCORE champion driver Dylan Evans, ICON Vehicle Dynamics has the unique qualities to design and build the highest quality suspension components and test them in both real world applications as well as race conditions.<br><br>We are often asked how ICON develops such revolutionary performance suspension systems. The answer might surprise you. Our engineers actually start by determining a desired outcome of the vehicle they are working on. By studying forces and their effect on the vehicle in motion (Vehicle Dynamics) they are able to determine what improvements can be made. They determine how they can improve drivability of the vehicle, how to improve the handling characteristics and what changes can be made to improve the vehicle in real world situations. The end result of all this study is the highest quality and performing suspension products in the world. What also sets ICON products apart is our incredible commitment of time and energy dedicated to both ride development and testing. From vehicle dynamic theory to our years of experience and involvement in off road racing, rock crawling and just about anything you can do with a vehicle on or off the road. Our engineers are in control and the driving force of our entire product line and manufacturing processes. This is made possible because all of our laser cutting, metal forming, CNC machining, welding and assembly is done in house. With a reputation built on quality, performance, and service it's clear that ICON Vehicle Dynamics is the top choice for performance suspension systems and shock absorbers for the most popular trucks and SUV's on the market.","156085,191517,198145,208444,213624,241204,241207,251795,254194,254197,260921,273283,273285,273286,56242,56244,70645,73151,153353,156083,191519,198147,198148,208445,213623,232907,251799,251800,254195,254198,260917,260919,273287,275798,57024,63123,63125,70644,73152,153351,232908,232910,241205,241208,251796,254196,260859,273282,56243,57025,63124,70646,73150,153352,156082,191518,213622,232906,232909,241206,241209,251797,251798,254199,260918,260920,273281,273284,57026","Body Diameter_PQ:2.5 in,Bottom Mount_PQ:Eyelet,Fitment_PQ:Direct Fit,Hydraulic / Gas Charged _PQ:Gas Charged,Location_PQ:Front,Shock Series_PQ:2.5 Coilover,Shock Type_PQ:Coil-Over,Top Mount_PQ:OEM",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The end result is a wheel that can withstand up to 1600 pounds weighing down on it.<br><br> <b>Is This Wheel Right for You?</b><br><br> One of the best things about the Rock Crawler is its universal designation. As long as you have lug nuts and a cap, you can put wheels from the Pro Comp 15x8 5x4.5 onto just about any axle.

The Goodyear Wrangler MTR With Kevlar tire has an asymmetrical tread design and the DuPont Kevlar reinforced sidewalls promises to be a contender in the hot MT tire market. Goodyear says using Kevlar increases sidewall toughness and puncture resistance by 35 percent. It also helps reinforce the sidewall for on-pavement driving. The asymmetrical tread design looks directional, but Goodyear says the tires are NOT directional, can run either way and have been tested that way. For those who don't like white lettering, the new MTR with Kevlar might disappoint, as many sizes will have white outline lettering. The rubber feels soft and supple when doing the old twist and fingernail tread test (scientific test procedure).
