If the steering on your Jeep, truck or SUV is not as good as it used to be, 4 Wheel Parts is the place to shop.

That is, if your machine tends to pull from side to side, you may find yourself somewhere you would rather not be. The Pro Comp dual steering stabilizer helps you stay on track. This easy-to-install stabilizer immediately smooths your ride while minimizing bump steer. Made with top-quality materials, the ES2000 stabilizer improves handling characteristics and reduces wheel vibration. The result is more even and straighter steering.

That's why Pro Comp also offers a lifetime warranty for as long as you own your vehicle against defects for all of our products<br><br>When you're taking tough terrain and large obstacles, your 4x4 needs to be ready to handle them. Of course, you're not going to settle for just a stock machine. Suspension upgrades are a wise move, but you need the right leveling kit to handle your vehicle's torsion bar suspension. That's where Pro Comp's leveling kits come in. As a leading maker of aftermarket lighting, wheels, tires and suspension upgrades, Pro Comp has been trusted by off-roaders for more than 25 years. Get the edge you want on the trail with a Pro Comp 2.5 inch torsion key leveling lift kit from 4 Wheel Parts.<br><br> <b>The Benefits of Leveling Kits</b><br><br> Installing a front leveling kit allows you to level out your 4x4's uneven ground stance, increasing your front end's height to equal that of the rear end. The Pro Comp 2.5 inch leveling lift kit is an inexpensive way to achieve this goal without negatively impacting your vehicle's comfort or ride quality. With the 2.5 inch kit, you gain enough clearance to add wheels and tires up to 33 inches in diameter.<br><br> <a href=""""https://www.4wheelparts.com/b/suspension/leveling-kits/_/N-cm5j0"""">Leveling kits</a> help you install larger tires, but they do much more for your machine than that. Add a set of high-quality aftermarket shocks and you can also achieve even better ground clearance. The amount of adjustment depends on the gear you install, of course, but these simple upgrades let you enjoy better off-road performance without sacrificing a smooth ride.<br><br> <b>Your Source for the Best Off-Roading Gear</b><br><br>","155656,155677,191188,193874,193888,206835,210810,210813,210816,211854,228393,228398,228521,241299,241300,241301,247794,247818,247823,253380,253431,155658,155668,191167,191168,191190,193876,193887,206841,206843,210805,228390,228402,228404,241288,241296,247805,247810,247822,248106,253377,253378,253382,253428,155666,191169,193875,210804,210809,210812,228399,228401,241289,241290,241295,247813,247824,253376,253383,253430,233385,241287,241297,241298,241302,247793,247811,247812,253379,253381,253429,155654,155670,191189,191191,193886,193889,206834,206836,206840,206842,210803,210811,210814,228391,228392,228400,228403","Bump Stops_PQ:None,Finish Color_PQ:Black,Fitment_PQ:Direct Fit,Front Lift Height_PQ:2.5 inch,Front Lift Method_PQ:Torsion Keys,Rear Lift Method (Where Applicable)_PQ:Front Lift Only,Shock Relocation Bracket_PQ:Longer Shocks Recommended,Spacer Material_PQ:Steel,Track Bar Drop_PQ:Does Not Include Track bar Drop,Type_PQ:Metal",NULL

If you want to add larger aftermarket wheels and tires to your rig without installing a complete suspension lift kit, Pro Comps Nitro Kits were designed with you specifically in mind.","253420,253423,262313,262316,262323,54317,55758,55762,56706,57186,57189,57193,57194,57242,57243,57253,57256,63932,70350,70392,70410,70411,70417,70478,73110,73135,73137,73138,73170,73171,7620,7622,7631,7632,147422,203421,207177,207191,207196,207216,207219,207220,210824,210828,210833,210843,210846,211059,214684,224731,224870,224873,224902,224904,224905,224907,238869,246159,246176,253371,253417,253421,262312,262322,262324,54315,54316,54318,55759,55761,56708,56710,57190,57192,57238,57241,57324,63196,63935,147418,63937,147424,67692,147426,70349,147432,70381,147438,70408,147442,147443,147507,147508,155770,155819,155823,155826,155834,155837,155849,155865,156187,191161,191164,191174,191179,191184,191187,191195,191196,191201,191392,191394,191418,193882,199971,200318,200320,200326,200332,200337,200338,200341,203419,207178,207194,207195,207215,210825,210829,210835,210847,211062,211065,212778,212779,212781,214683,224734,224858,224869,224871,224874,224896,224903,238863,238864,238878,238879,246172,246175,247991,247993,253369,253416,262315,262318,54314,55012,55760,56709,57239,57240,57323,63933,63934,70379,70390,70391,70409,70419,70421,70470,73129,73130,73136,73144,73158,7623,7625,7628,7634,147431,147434,147506,147514,155768,155815,155830,155839,155859,155861,155867,156184,191165,191173,191178,191181,191199,191202,191390,191414,191416,191419,193871,193880,193883,200329,200333,200334,200342,203418,203420,70413,70431,73109,73111,73128,73131,73133,73134,73143,73155,73160,73169,73172,73173,7621,7624,7626,7633,147423,147425,147428,147433,147439,147441,147447,147504,147509,147512,147513,155772,155817,155821,155824,155835,155851,155853,155869,156183,191163,191166,191175,191180,191183,191186,191197,191198,191200,191395,191404,193869,193872,193885,199969,200321,200324,200335,200336,200340,203423,207179,207218,210826,210834,210841,210844,211058,211061,212780,214689,214690,214691,224733,224859,224862,224863,224872,224875,224894,224897,224906,238867,238868,238877,246157,246171,246173,253370,253422,262311,262314,262317,56707,57191,57244,57252,63195,63936,70378,70380,70389,70396,70412,70418,70477,70479,70881,71095,73127,73132,73146,73154,73157,73168,73174,7619,7627,7629,7630,7635,7636,147427,147429,147430,147437,147440,147505,147510,147511,147516,155828,155832,155841,155847,155855,155857,155863,156188,191162,191182,191185,191402,191415,193868,193870,193873,193881,193884,199970,200325,200327,200328,200339,200343,203422,207176,207192,207193,207217,210827,210842,210845,211060,211063,214685,215298,224732,224860,224861,224876,232878,238865,238866,238870,246158,246174,253418,253419","Bump Stops_PQ:None,Finish Color_PQ:Black,Fitment_PQ:Direct Fit,Front Lift Height_PQ:2.25 inch,Front Lift Method_PQ:Coil Spring Spacers,Rear Lift Method (Where Applicable)_PQ:Coil Spring Spacers,Shock Relocation Bracket_PQ:Longer Shocks Recommended,Spacer Material_PQ:Steel,Track Bar Drop_PQ:Does Not Include Track bar Drop,Type_PQ:Metal",NULL

Ride quality is improved by reducing the control arm angles. By doing so, the control arm is no longer working against the coil spring and shock during the suspension cycle. The result, a smoother ride with less of a jarring feeling on rough, around town roads and small off road impacts like rocks and ledges. The new mounting positions also corrects Anti-Dive, the feeling of the front of the vehicle compressing during hard braking.

Rear geometry correction brackets and coil spacers maintain the factory load-carrying capacity while keeping the handling and predictability of the factory Ram 5-link suspension.  The new Pro Comp suspension system is compatible with the factory stability control system and adaptive cruise control, and allows clearance of up to a 37-inch tire.  Pro Comp suspension systems are proudly designed, tested and manufactured in Chula Vista, CA with the goal of improving vehicle performance and drivability.","253,748,262,378,262,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000","Fitment_PQ:Direct Fit,Front Shocks_PQ:Re use OEM,Lift Height Range_PQ:6-7 Inches,Rear Lift Component_PQ:Spacer,Rear Shocks_PQ:ES9000,Shocks Series_PQ:ES9000",NULL

A steel composition is ideal for driving over rough terrain, and that is why recommend the Pro Comp 15x8.

You will be able to find these wheels and many other ones when you peruse our inventory at 4WheelParts.com sourced from over 600 manufacturers.<br><br> <b>How a Wheel Should Be Made</b><br><br> Pro Comp starts the manufacturing process of its elite Pro Comp Series 51 15x8 wheels with the best modern production equipment. Among this series, you will find that the Rock Crawler Xtreme Black Steel Wheels go above and beyond the call of duty. These specific wheels are painted with a flat black powder coating that is designed to stick without rubbing off. The end result is a wheel that can withstand up to 1600 pounds weighing down on it.<br><br> <b>Is This Wheel Right for You?</b><br><br> One of the best things about the Rock Crawler is its universal designation. As long as you have lug nuts and a cap, you can put wheels from the Pro Comp 15x8 5x4.5 onto just about any axle. All you need to do is make sure you have the right level of fender clearance for this deep dish wheel.
