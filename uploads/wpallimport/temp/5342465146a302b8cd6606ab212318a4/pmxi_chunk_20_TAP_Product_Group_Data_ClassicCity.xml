		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Goodyear Wrangler MTR With Kevlar tire has an asymmetrical tread design and the DuPont Kevlar reinforced sidewalls promises to be a contender in the hot MT tire market. Goodyear says using Kevlar increases sidewall toughness and puncture resistance by 35 percent. It also helps reinforce the sidewall for on-pavement driving. The asymmetrical tread design looks directional, but Goodyear says the tires are NOT directional, can run either way and have been tested that way. For those who don't like white lettering, the new MTR with Kevlar might disappoint, as many sizes will have white outline lettering. That means white outline letters out, ready to be scraped into white sidewalls by rocks. The larger sizes up to 42 inches, will have black lettering, so that will be fine.The silica tread compound enhances wet traction and the durometer seems to be between the old MTR and the sticky comp tires Goodyear has built. The rubber feels soft and supple when doing the old twist and fingernail tread test (scientific test procedure). The Goodyear MTR with Kevlar is a very competent tire and worthy descendent of the Wrangler MT and MTR.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The K&N throttle control module is designed to improve throttle response and acceleration, and increases pedal sensitivity without modifying factory ECU settings. The system processes input data from the gas pedal, and modifies the signal before sending it to the ECU for an adjustable level of sensitivity, creating an increase in throttle responsiveness that will make your car feel like a whole new machine. The throttle control module can typically be installed in less than 30 minutes with no software required, and is adjustable on-the-go, helping you fine-tune the sensitivity of your throttle response. The kit includes the module, wiring harness, adjustable knob, hardware, and detailed instructions. How it works - The Throttle Control Module processes input data from the gas pedal, and modifies the signal before sending it to the ECU for an adjustable level of sensitivity, creating an increase in throttle responsiveness. Wire harness - The wire harness connects the Throttle Control Module's electronic control unit to the throttle pedal on the vehicle, allowing a direct connection between your gas pedal and throttle body. The plugs and connectors are designed to attach directly to your vehicle's stock components for easy plug-and-play installation. Control dial - The stylish aluminum control dial installs into the cab of your vehicle to give you direct control over your Throttle Control Module, allowing you to adjust how much or how little the throttle signal is adjusted.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Low Range Off Road's own design of a Sport Cage. They manufactured these in house here in Utah, USA from DOM Steel. Why is DOM Steel Better? DOM is seamless tubing used to make roll cages, buggy chassis and drag racing chassis. It is drawn across a mandrel to be exactly the size it is determined to be.  Since it goes across a mandrel it creates the weld seam to disappear, and pressures the steel in a way that is like a forging process for tubing. This means it is harder to crush and much less likely to break or bend in area's you need it the most. <br>Homemade cages have issues with doors closing correctly due to the nature of the tubing having to run down the side of the dash.  <br><br>Low Range's Design department came up with a viable solution to this problem by making the attachment to the front portion of the cage by laser cut steel plate.  With their unique design elements, the front doors shut correctly and do not ruin your nice paint job or your door panels.  This also makes it easier to run your door straps.  <br>Integrated into the design is a speaker grille that can easily be removed for speaker installation.  Since this is also made from the same material, it protects your speakers from damage. <br><br>Many Rear cage portions have their benefits and drawbacks.  Usually they require drilling into the floor of the body, causing an area for squeaks, rattles and a place for the elements to enter your cab.  Low Range Off Road has fixed this by making the rear cage bolt into the floor of the tub.  Utilizing a large floor plate, it spreads the load across a large area, creating a stong attachment point.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Corbeau universal seat heating systems are among the highest quality seat-heating units available today. Those who have ever experienced the luxury of a seat heater know that once you've taken pleasure in a seat heater, it almost becomes a necessity. We've now made it possible to get a high quality seat-heating unit at an affordable price. Corbeau Seat Heaters can be installed in your Corbeau Seats or in your factory seats in a matter of minutes. While we always recommend you have these installed by a professional, the installation is really quite simple. Two wires, a positive and ground wire, connect to your factory electrical system. What's great about our heaters is they will heat up within two minutes. The patented heat flow system forces the heat from the heater to only go upward towards the body as opposed to a downward flow into the seat itself. This means your body will feel the majority of the heat flow and will warm up faster than most seat heaters. Corbeau Seat heating pads feature carbon fiber technology, which is regarded as one of the finest heating pad materials available today.  Corbeau seat heaters are custom in that the heating pads can be trimmed to size to ensure proper fitment on your seat.]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[Speedometer calibration;Alters TPMS sensors;Activates daytime running lights; One-touch turn signals;Temporarily increased engine idle speed for winching;Clear engine codes;<b>California Residents: <a href="/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[AEV's ProCal Module is a hand-held powerhouse! This essential tool provides JK owners an easy, low-cost way to make a variety of useful changes not offered by the dealer or any other re-programmer. Topping the list is the ability to correct the speedometer and gear ratio when larger tires are installed. When the speedometer is left uncorrected, there is a major degradation in the performance of the stability control (ESP), transmission shifting, and engine performance. The best part of the ProCal is that it isn't just for correcting the speedometer. The Tire Pressure Monitoring System can now be recalibrated to better suit aftermarket tires without triggering the dash light. Further, the ProCal Module makes it possible to activate daytime running lamps, one-touch turn signals, enable a temporarily increased engine idle speed for winching, clear engine codes, and even has a feature to help alignment technicians align the vehicle perfectly for optimal ESP performance. The ProCal Module is equipped with a series of easy-to-use DIP switches. By reading the simple Quick Reference Guide included with the ProCal module, a user can quickly dial in a code for the desired recalibration. Once the DIP switches are set, simply plug the Module into the vehicle's OBDII. The whole process can be completed in mere minutes and it's just as easy to restore the vehicle back to its original settings with the ProCal. NOTES: The AEV ProCal will enable axle gear ratio changes to be made to Wranglers equipped with the A580 Automatic transmission (2011+ 2.8L, 2012+ 3.6L) The AEV ProCal cannot change axle gear ratios for 2011+ 2.8L CRD diesel Wranglers with manual transmissions. See more in the FAQ. Key Features:  Correct speedometer  "One touch" turn signals  Clear engine codes  Easy to use DIP switches  Recalibrate tire pressure monitor  Increase engine idle speed  Optimize ESP performance"]]></sales_desc>

To add to the look each spoke rolls back with a nice concave to give that sporty feel. When you are looking at the top, reach for the PEAK for your Truck and SUV. Available in 20,22" in Matte Black or Gloss Black with a Mirror Cut Face. Each Black Rhino wheel is engineered to carry the heavy loads often associated with Trucks and SUV's. All wheels are either hub-centric or supplied with centering rings to ensure a smooth vibration free ride. PEAK truck wheels by Black Rhino.<br><br> The Peak Rotary Forged Wheel is manufactured using a highly advanced production technique called Rotary Forging. The rim of the wheels is forged at high pressure while the wheel is spun at high speed. This alters the molecular structure and enhances the strength of the alloy. The benefit is a much lighter weight than a regular cast wheel. Most importantly, the weight saving is in the outer rim of the wheel which dramatically reduces rotational mass and enhances vehicle performance."]]></sales_desc>

Engineered to be a full 27% stronger than the previous version, it brings race-level performance to the masses.

The new ring also uses a specialized 45-degree diamond knurl pattern while the bead area of the wheel features Pro-Comp's patented Infini-Grip figure eight pattern. Together they form a super team of grip that keeps the bead locked securely in place regardless of air pressure or impacts. Already battle tested in the harsh deserts of the Baja 1000 and the jagged rocks of King of the Hammers, the next-generation Pro Comp Beadlock wheel can be trusted to thrive in the most extreme environments.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[As you know, the Toyota Tacoma is a superb off-road vehicle, but the stock bumper and trim are lightweight pieces that provide little or no protection to the front end of your Tacoma when you're off-road.<br><br>All-Pro Off Road has designed a Front Winch Bumper for 95-04 Tacomas to protect the front end of your Toyota, improve off-road capability, and allow for the mounting of up to a 9500-lb. capacity recovery winch with remote solenoid (use of an integrated solenoid winch will require grille trimming).  The winch mounting surface has the common 10 x 4.5 bolt pattern used by Warn and other winch manufacturers.  Tabs are included for mounting a winch fairlead.<br><br>This bumper is mostly built from heavy-duty .120 wall, 1.75 and 1.5 diameter tubing with CNC laser cut and brake formed 3/16 plate steel for the winch structure and mounting plates.  The sides wrap around the fenders and there's a bottom hoop that serves as protection for the low hanging radiator with an integrated steel skid plate.  All-Pro offers additional skid plates that attach to the bumper and protect the IFS and transmission (the factory skid plate is not compatible).  Approach angles are greatly improved because the bumper tucks up and out of the way, providing much more clearance than the factory bumper. <br><br>This bumper ships unpainted so that you can finish it to your liking.  It simply bolts on using the factory hardware (see instructions for 98-00 models below).  We have included 2 light mounting tabs so that you can easily mount up to 6 lights.  Please note turn signal mounts are not included, but you can either re-use your stock turn signals with some simple modifications or use universal style lights available at most parts stores.  Another option is to modify the factory corner lights to accept a filament bulb (1157 style) so they will function as a marker AND a turn signal light, eliminating the factory turn signal completely.<br><br>The Baja Taco options may be ad"]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[All-Pro APEX series bumpers were designed to meet customer demands for durable, low profile bumpers that look as good as they function. The APEX Tacoma Front Bumper is ideal for trucks running 35 or larger tires and those requiring winch and light mounts. These bumpers are made from CNC laser cut, brake-formed 3/16" steel plate and are MIG welded to strict standards. We install two 1" thick recovery points made from 1.5" x .250"" wall DOM tubing and 3/8" steel plate which are tied directly to the frame.<br><br>Multiple lighting configurations are possible thanks to two 4" light mounts on the front, two light mounts on top, and optional light bar hoops. 2" amber turn signals are included. The optional LED Hoop gives space to mount a small light bar while the optional Center Hoop is tall enough to offer grille protection as well as providing two additional light mount tabs. Both hoops are made from 1.75" x .120 wall DOM tubing. All-Pro IFS Skid Plates attach directly to this bumper."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Our Rock Sliders have been trail tested on some of the most grueling trails around, from the Rubicon to the Hammers. They are built from heavy-duty .120 wall tubing. The shape of our Rock Sliders is very critical and determines how much body protection it will provide as well as how the truck slides along the obstacles without getting hung up. The outer tubes of the Tundra Rock Sliders are 1.75" in diameter, and angle upward to provide maximum ground clearance and door protection. All-Pro Rock Sliders not only look great but can be used as a lift point, easily holding the full weight of the vehicle.<br><br>Made from hefty 1.75" x .120" wall DOM steel tubing for the outer structure with 2" square legs that are fully gusseted. They also feature a full-length mounting L-bracket that captures existing holes in the side of your frame with minimal drilling only on the underside using the included countersunk bolts for a smooth surface with no bolts exposed. Also included is a one-piece CNC laser cut .125" steel fill plate with dimple die holes and the APEX logo on the kick-out portion."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Made of a resilient poly material, the Dee Zee Poly Crossover Tool Box combines the functionality of a crossover tool box with the benefits of hardened poly plastic. This tough box can handle all the abuse you can throw at it, without sagging or denting. The center cross support ties the rear and the front together for additional support. The box has a double-wall lid for rigidity and features a molded brite-tread pattern and textured plastic. The overlapping flap on the lid deflects water from entering the box, where the next line of defense awaits with a foam gasket. You can trust your tools, camping gear or even your golf clubs will benefit from these features. Don't think you are sacrificing security with a lightweight ridgid frame. Metal striker plates are integrated into the lid to engage a full-length locking rod. This single moving part sucks down the entire rigid lid for secure closure every time. The rotary keyed lock stops the bar from moving when locked. Both the keyhole and sliding rod operate from the driver's side. The narrow design avoids interference with truck bed wheel wells and this box can be shipped via ground transportation without any large package surcharges! Going hunting or camping this weekend and need something overnighted to your doorstep? Boom! Available in two lengths to fit midsize trucks (63) and full-size trucks (70"), this box has a discrete look with its low-profile lid that only sits inches above the bed rail and matches spray in bed liners."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[ORACLE Lighting's new V-Series bulbs feature our SmartDrive Active Thermal Regulation (ATR) temperature management. The integrated constant current linear LED driver inside the bulb uses a system called thermal foldback to protect the LEDs and the bulb components.<br><br>The LED driver operates from a 6V to 24V input and offers constant current output at up to 1 Amp. If the bulb becomes hot and surpasses optimal working temperature, the driver can reduce the current by altering the PWM duty cycle until temperature stabilizes. Supplementing passive thermal management with active techniques such as this allow for a very small bulb package without risking damage to the LED or creating an environment where the LED lifetime would otherwise be significantly shortened. Although reducing the current reduces luminosity, the current reduction is minimal and such that the change in luminosity is below the threshold that a consumer can detect. Fortunately, the human eye is poor at detecting luminosity changes in high-brightness devices so there is reasonable flexibility in the balance between controlling temperature and noticeably compromising luminosity."]]></sales_desc>
