		<long_desc><![CDATA[Trail-Gear introduces a new concept to the axle housing design. This exclusive design features axle tubes that have been offset above the housing centerline making the inner axle shafts ride near the bottom of the axle tubes rather than in the center. This repositioning of the axle tube results are an increase of 3/8in. ground clearance under the axle tubing. Trail Gear uses axle tubes made from 5/16 inch thick, high strength DOM steel tubing and engage 5/8in. farther into the center section. On top of that, there is a 360 gusset welded around the tubes on the inside of the housing to ensure unparalleled strength. The heavy-duty, press formed, 1/4in. plate steel center section shell is specially shaped to ensure a minimum of 3/4in. additional clearance under the differential. The differential mounting surface is made from inch plate steel to ensure studs can not pull out, even under heavy loads. The outer offset flanges are made from 4130 Chromoly to prevent distortion or bending. Housings are precision aligned using start-of-the-art, 3D digital imaging equipment.;<b>California Residents: <a href=/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Banks Ram-Air Intake System delivers exceptional airflow and air density. Its large lifetime air filter requires fewer cleanings than competitive filters. With its giant outlet, streamlined components and enclosed cold-air box that keeps hot engine air out of the intake, the Ram-Air flows up to 66% better than stock. Improves power and MPG while lowering exhaust gas temperatures. Banks' unique 5 bellows accommodates engine movement, preventing component damage and prolonging service life. Designed to not cause fault or error codes; lifetime warranty on filter element. Unlike our competitors, Banks doesn't just build-and-ship. Our Ram-Airs are triple validated before the name Banks is stamped on. We test; they don't. That's the Banks difference!]]></sales_desc>

The K&N 77 Series features bolt-on installation with common hand tools and allows your engine to breathe easier by incorporating K&N's exclusive high-flow filter gauze material.  The material is not only chock full of performance benefits, but is also durable and requires minimal servicing vs. full-on replacement like other OEM filter replacements, saving you money over the life of your vehicle.</br><br>K&N's popular 77 Series metal cold air intake systems for trucks and SUV's combine outstanding performance and sharp under-the-hood styling. The metallic finishes found on the mandrel-bent piping are not only eye-catching, but are designed to maximize airflow. K&N's chrome-like finish part numbers end in KP" while the more understated Grey finish kits end in "KG"perfect for the sleeper look.</br>  <br>Often times, restriction can exist between an air filter and the engine in the form of less-than-optimal bends and/or smaller diameter ducting. This is one of the weakest links in the airflow chain", which robs a vehicle of its natural horsepower. More often than not, that weak point is the factory air path leading to the engine serves as a bottleneck for performance. K&N 77-Series High Performance Air Intake Systems virtually eliminates air path restriction by replacing the air filter with a high-performance unit thereby creating less airflow resistance to the engine.  The aluminum tube is properly engineered and effectively drives a cleaner flow of air into the engine, which translates into more horsepower, torque and fuel economy.</br><br>Though mass-produced to keep up with white-hot demand, K&N 77 Series kits have the look and feel of custom-made units. They come with an oversized high-flow conical air filter designed to provide increased surface area and dust filtration. The"]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[<br>The Eaton ELocker is an electronically-selectable locking differential designed for drivers that need maximum traction on-demand. The ELocker works like this: while driving under normal conditions, it performs just like an open differential. However, that's where the lone similarity ends.  If an obstacle is encountered  a rocky trail, muddy ditch or other challenge  the driver has the ability to actuate the dash-mounted switch to activate 100% axle lock for maximum traction.  The electromagnetic mechanism locks, capturing all of the engine's torque and sends equal amounts of it to the drive wheels.  A second flip of the switch deactivates the unit to resume normal driving.</br><br>In addition, the ELocker's internal gears are net-forged, providing the strength and durability necessary for off-road and recreational driving. Unlike traditional forging, net-forging allows for a more precise gear which improves performance and reliability.  Moreover, the electronic control also provides added reliability over similar air-controlled products and a cleaner overall install.</br><br>Only Eaton offers the broadest portfolio of differentials to meet the unique needs of performance and enthusiast drivers on the market today.  Their lineup includes locking and limited-slip differentials, automatically engaging and driver selectable units as well.  Choosing an Eaton Performance differential not only ensures ultimate performance, but their superior product quality reduces time spent in the garage and decreases wallet-draining driveline repairs.</br>]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[These unique steering wheel designs are inspired by classic wheel styles of the past to create a modern interpretation of a proud automotive heritage. The Heritage Collection features larger diameter machined aluminum steering wheels. The spokes are machined 6061T6 Alcoa aluminum in a range of designs, polished to a mirror finish. The wheels have finger grips on the back of the rim for additional comfort and style. The modular construction creates a wheel rim that is covered completely with leather, mahogany, or smooth urethane, not with a partial aluminum rim as used in many billet wheels. The modular grip also allows the ultimate customization! Enthusiasts now have the ability to remove the rim and recover the leather to match any interior. The mahogany versions can be removed and painted to match any custom paint scheme. The center of each wheel has a polished aluminum center cap which complements the wheel design. A Grant Installation Kit is necessary to mount this wheel to a vehicle. This wheel will work with Grant Standard 3000 or 4000 Series, Billet 5000 Series, or Euro 6000 Series Installation Kits.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[TransCommand is an automatic-transmission-management computer that delivers functions that no single module can. Many truck owners prefer firmer shifts, especially when hauling large loads. TransCommand is the quick, efficient cure. The electronic module senses the load and commands the transmission to raise the hydraulic pressure accordingly. Light-throttle shifts are smooth and firm, while full-throttle or heavy-load driving produces solid, decisive shifts. Excessive clutch slippage is eliminated, extending transmission life.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Banks TorqueTube is a streamlined exhaust manifold designed to optimize exhaust flow and engine efficiency. Because the stock manifold's flange does not align squarely with the ports, flow is restricted. TorqueTube corrects the problem with a half-inch flange that is machined dead flat, and precisely fitted to the port pattern. You can hear the difference in the plusher, healthier exhaust note. Unlike the stock, failure-prone exhaust manifold, Banks TorqueTube is built of heavy, 409 stainless steel to weather a lifetime of heat, stress and abuse. The flange, welded to the tube assembly on both sides, will never crack or separate. The gasket is made of SMI 900, a material that stands up to super-hot temperatures. Bolts right on!]]></sales_desc>

This utility box can outlast even the most motivated intruders.Our patented locking design lets you use your own one inch shackle padlock on the side of the box. The shackle is nested inside the side of the tool box, making it impossible to reach with bolt cutters. Choosing a BOLT padlock allows you to use your own truck ignition key to open the lock. No more carrying a full key ring to access various locks on the job site. (padlock sold separately)Heavy-duty striker bolts are latched with a patented slide mechanism. The chest lid closes with a single moving part for unmatched strength and security by eliminating weak welded points. The slide is released from the drivers side and releases the dual bolt strikers. An automotive grade rubber bulb seal wraps the undercarriage of the lid to resist Mother Nature's wrath.The Padlock Utility Chest has dampened gas shocks to keep the lid open at a 90-degree angle for full access to all your gear. A sliding plastic tool tray keeps smaller items organized and always within reach.]]></sales_desc>
