		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Get genuine performance from genuine Spicer. Spicer parts are designed, engineered, and manufactured to meet or exceed OE requirements because they are OE parts, ensuring a perfect fit with our full line of industry-leading axles. That's why Spicer is the name you can trust for top performance and durability. Through heat treating and a slower quality scan rate, Dana is able to deliver a much more consistent and stronger Spicer axle shaft. In addition, the cold-formed rolled spline eliminates the need for machining, which can cause stress fractures and premature failures. And not only are Spicer axle shafts fatigue-tested to last, 100% of our front axle parts are ultrasonically tested, so we're able to check for any internal cracks that regular magnetic testing can't reach. We're proud to claim a safety factor that's high even by OE standardsbecause when it comes to the performance of your axles, there's no room for compromise.<br></br>The same heat treating, slower quality scan rate and cold-formed rolled spline also enable Spicer to deliver a much more consistent and stronger rear axle shaft, with less of the machining that can lead to stress fractures and premature failure. In addition, Spicer rear axle shafts undergo the same fatigue testing and ultrasonic testing, delivering a safety factor that's high even by OE standards.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Poison Spyder Trail Cage is designed for those Jeep owners who already have the factory roll bar, and would like to add on to it to form a full roll cage rather than installing a complete new cage. The Trail Cage kit is an eight piece set. It comes with two Lower A-Pillars (dash to floor supports) and two tubular Upper A-pillars that are to be welded to the factory windshield bars. Also included are a dash bar, upper windshield bar, and two center spreaders that can be located in several positions.<br></br>The Poison Spyder Trail Cage kit comes disassembled and requires welding to install.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[If you've had your Jeep in the rocksespecially extreme rock trails like The Hammersyou know what this is all about. The stock body mounts on the Jeep TJ are made of pretty thin sheetmetal. Combine that with the fact that they're hanging right there in the way when you're trying to squeeze through, around, and over the rocks. The result is they can take quite a beating, and usually end up looking like they've been hit with a wrecking ball. Repeatedly. Not only that, the stock perches weren't designed with rockodynamics" in mindthat is, they're not very good at sliding over the rocks rather than hanging up on them."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[From its retractable function, which permits opening or closing in literally seconds, to its rigid, vinyl-over-aluminum laminated construction, the Roll-N-Lock M-Series hybrid cover offers everything other covers do not. There are no snaps to manipulate, there is no roll or bundle to lash down or stow, no crossbars to negotiate, no fabric shrinkage to struggle with, no folding or solid hinged covers to combat, and, best of all, no worries about the security of cargo. The Roll-N-Lock M-Series tonneau coverby far the most intelligent and versatile tonneau cover made. <br>What sets Roll-N-Lock's M-Series tonneau cover construction apart from the competition is not just the superior quality of our vinyl surface material, but also the design of the slatted aluminum substrate which supports the vinyl. Each Roll-N-Lock slat is rotatively joined by an interlocking hinge. It is the geometry of this uniquely-contoured hinge that lends Roll-N-Lock tonneau covers their strength, quiet, smooth, non-binding movement and roll compactness. Close examination of the Roll-N-Lock hinge in the flat position reveals the fact that each slat is inseparably locked together, yet when rotated, no metal-to-metal contact occurs.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[<br>Put more power to the pavement with Auburn Gear's HP Series Limited Slip Differential (LSD).  Unlike plate or gear-type differentials, Auburn Gear's HP LSD features a unique cone clutch design which provides additional torque bias.  That improved torque bias improves both traction and performance. Torque bias is the ability of any LSD to transfer torque from the wheel with the least amount of traction to the wheel with the most amount of traction.</br>  <br>If your off-road vehicle serves double-duty as both a recreational vehicle and daily driver, the Auburn Gear HP LSD provides smooth engagement and actuation with none of the annoying clatter found with solid spools.  The driving experience makes for peace-of-mind operation, with less drivetrain fatigue and shock that's common with performance-only spools.</br>  <br>The Auburn Gear HP LSD is made right here in the USA, and offers a generous 4-year replacement via the D-RE program along with the standard 1-year warranty.</br>]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[<br>Finally, Auburn Gear offers a solution which offers two traction enhancing differentials in one package: a full-time limited-slip for daily driving in addition to a full-locking differential, which can be activated at the flip of a switch.  The selection between both modes can be done on-the-fly, so you don't have to press pause during the middle of your off-road excursion.</br>    <br>How it works: The Auburn Gear Ected Max is a selectable traction device; an on/off switch is mounted near the driver. When off (limted-slip mode), the clutch pack provides the smooth actuation of a standard open differential. As torque increases, the separating forces within the differential gears increase, causing the clutch pack to be compressed and thereby providing bias torque to the high traction wheel.  This essentially acts as your performance limited-slip differential.  When the user flicks the switch to on, electrical current is sent to the electromagnetic coil which engages full-lock, allowing both drive wheels to receive equal amounts of torque.</br>   <br>This will allow your vehicle to climb out of trouble--all at the flip of a switch. You get the high-performance daily driveability of a limited-slip differential with the full-locking action of a solid spool/locker--the best of both worlds.</br> <br>Lastly, the Auburn Gear Ected Max Differential comes with a 1-year warranty, further boosting both peace-of- mind and value.</br>"]]></sales_desc>

The RockBrawler is fabricated from 3/16 inch high pressure steel plate, CNC laser cut and brake-formed for a precise fit. The Stinger is made of 1.75 inch X .120 wall DOM tubing, and extends inside the bumper shell to the inner braces for added strength.<br><br>The two D-ring shackle mounts are CNC-machined from 1 inch plate steel to provide brute strength for the most demanding recovery operations. Speaking of recovery, the integrated winch mount accepts most major manufacturer's winches up to 15,000 lbs. capacity, including the innovative Warn PowerPlant with integrated air compressor. The winch fairlead plate is flawlessly integrated into the bumper design, and doubles as gusseting for the Stinger, complete with Poison Spyder's signature oval lightning holes. Recessed light mounts are provided for retention of the factory fog lamps or aftermarket off-road lamps of your choice, and protect each one in a deep well of cold hard steel.<br><br>Another characteristic of the RockBrawler is its amazing tire clearance. The bumper has faceted ends that angle inward, giving your Jeep the ultimate in clearance for large tires, even under maximized suspension movement, and during full turn scenarios. The angled sillouhette of the bumper ends allow for this tire clearance while still protecting the lower corner of the Jeep's grille. The RockBrawler's removable lower cover has an integrated skid plate for protecting the front sway bar disconnect mechanism. Jeep JK models that are not equipped with the factory sway bar disconnect can still utilize this lower skid as added protection for the front end components. The fasteners for this cover/skid, as well as all external fasteners provided with the RockBrawler, are stainless steel flat-head cap screws for a flush surface and protection from the rocks.<br>]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Jeep JK's, are extremely vulnerable to rocker armor damage on the trail. Poison Spyder Brawler Rockers provide the ultimate rocker armor protection while actually enhancing your Jeep's off-road capabilitynot to mention they look bad-ass! Brawler Rockers are two-piece mini-boatside" style rocker armor. Each component is fabricated entirely of CNC-laser cut, precision brake-formed 3/16" plate steel. The upper piece fits the lower section of your Jeep's exterior sheet metal like a glove, conforming to the subtle curvature of the JK and providing protection similar to Poison Spyder's JK Body Armor. The lower piece incorporates an extremely strong rub rail that protrudes about 3-1/4" outboard of the Jeep's body tub. The top surface of the rub rail may also serve as an entry step. Below, the brake-formed 3/16" plate steel angles down and inward to form a high clearance boatside for sliding off of rocks and obstacles. Inside, an array of beefy 3/16" thick internal gussets provide ultimate strength to the Brawler Rocker. Oval lightning holes along the length of the boatside section provide great Poison Spyder looks while allowing access to hose out mud and debris after a day on the trail. The ends of the Brawler Rockers are capped in the same 3/16" plate steel, in angled facets that allow up to a 40" tire and visually integrate with the lines of Poison Spyder front and rear JK Crusher Flares. The upper piece attaches to the body tube using supplied stainless steel flat-head cap screws and nut-serts. The lower piece attaches to the upper piece also with stainless steel flat-head cap screws and easy-to-install clip-nuts. All fastener holes are countersunk for a flat surface using the flat-head hardware. Underneath, the lower piece attaches at the Jeep's body mounts. Attaching the Brawler Rockers in this way, along several different planes, provides triangulated strength to the entire assembly. The body-mount tie-ins ensure that they are securely integrated to the strongest"]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[<br>The Poison Spyder Rear Stinger Tire Carrier is the ultimate rear bumper for hard core rock crawling. Like many Poison Spyder original designs, the Rear Stinger concept has been copied by many manufacturers, but none come close to the quality, function, performance and awesome appearance of original. Built for light weight, high clearance, ease of use and a measure of rear-flop protection, the Poison Spyder Rear Stinger is designed for those who spend most of their time in the rocks and need a tire carrier that meets the challenge.<br><br>The Rear Stinger is basically a fold-down spare tire carrier. By pulling the two upper pins, the tire carrier can swing down, making loading and unloading of ehuge off-road tires easier. Simply roll the tire up into the carrier, secure it with the provided 3-Way Spare Tire Strap, then swing the carrier back up and pin it in place. The main components are fabricated from NC-bent DOM tubing and CNC laser-cut plate steel.<br><br>This part number is for the DIY" Rear Stinger Tire Carrier without the Lower Mount Plate. This would be useful for those who would like to use the Poison Spyder Rear Stinger with their existing bumper, or for adapting it for use on Jeep models and other 4X4's for which we do not yet make a model-specific kit. Note that he kit does NOT provide mounting tabs to attach the Stinger to your bumper, so you will need to fabricate or source these tabs separately. Note that the upper attachment arms are located at the correct width and height for mounting to a TJ without a body lift. If you are using this kit with other vehicles you may wish to have us ship the kit with the arms un-welded, so that you may weld them in at your custom width/height during installation. If you would like the arms un-welded, please make a note of it in the comments section when ordering.<br><br>The Tire Carrier includes an integrated skid plate with laser cut lightning holes and Spyder logo. It also has an integrated license plate mo"]]></sales_desc>

A 1.75 inch mandrel bent tube guard protects the winch, grill and radiator from potential damage. Integrated d-ring mounts aid with recovery equipment.

BD?s NEW ?Big? fine spline input shaft, 0.125 thicker than the stock size shaft and includes a hardened billet hub. By increasing Direct clutch apply piston width we increase apply pressure, and, by decreasing piston thickness we can install up to 30% more clutch surface. Matching BD?s Big bore, fine spline triple Torque Force Converter to the new Big Shaft make them designed for Competition 550 RWHP and above applications. By design, OEM transmission Helical gears and engine torque thrusting causes stock plastic and Babbitt thrust washers to melt and break down contaminating lubrication oil and damaging solenoids. We remove the thrust washers and install roller bearings throughout the transmission which eliminates oil contamination, maintains tolerances, reduces heat and prevents premature solenoid failure.]]></sales_desc>

The benefit with LED is ten time less power consumption and instant on. Bulbs are designed to fit turn signals, brake lights, reverse indicators, dome lights, and any other standard light receptacle, with the exception of the headlights. Due to the increased efficiency of LED bulbs over halogen bulbs, your vehicle may have faster blinking that factory, because the vehicle doesn't get the halogen amperage draw. To resolve this, Vision X has introduced the HIL-Resistor which is sold separately, which increases the resistance and eliminates any fast blinking or bulb out indicators.;<b>California Residents: <a href=/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>

The turbulent air charge is carried through past intake valves for better atomization and more complete combustion! The Econoaid Throttle Body Booster will give you a crisper throttle response, along with better Gas Mileage. A huge benefit of the Econoaid is the fuel savings. The Results of this fuel saving device will always vary depending on vehicle type, driving habits, age of the vehicle, and driving environment, among other factors. However, from the reports of our customers, the average vehicle will see an extra 1-3 MPG and produce an extra 6-10 Ft.lbs of Torque, which can be felt from the increased low-end throttle response. The Econoaid Throttle Body Booster will pay for itself in no time at all, especially with current increasing gas prices.]]></sales_desc>

The EPS has 2 120VAC and 1 12VDC outlets, Overload Protection, Low Oil Sensor, Parallel Cable Ports, Electric Start, and Digital Display for easy monitoring.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Bilstein's technically superior, patented monotube gas charged design allows the excessive heat from the oil to transfer to the outer surface of the shock body and dissipate more efficiently. The dividing piston also permits the oil to expand as heat builds, preventing aeration (foaming) and viscosity loss. This allows the shock to maintain full damping characteristics as temperatures rise.The tube of a Bilstein Gas Pressure Shock Absorber is fabricated using a special extrusion method. This process achieves an extremely tight peak-to-valley tolerance and maintains consistent wall thickness. Bilstein's seamless monotube design provides superior tube strength while maximizing heat dissipation and shock life.The piston head design allows independent tuning of the compression and rebound damping forces to provide optimum ride comfort and performance without compromise. It features fewer parts than most conventional twin tube and so called road sensing shock designs. This simple, yet exceptionally functional digressive design contributes to the extreme durability and long life of Bilstein Shock Absorbers.]]></sales_desc>

Optimal tooth profiles are also employed, which keeps operation both smooth and quiet.<br></br> When you purchase genuine Spicer ring and pinion gear sets, you can be confident the ring and pinion set will meet or exceed the exact Dana standards that original equipment manufacturers have relied upon for more than a hundred years.<br></br> The ring and pinions are manufactured with a special grade of steel, machined and heat-treated, so you can count on properly matched sets for optimal set-up and mesh.<br></br> Remember: Non-genuine replacement parts are usually not manufactured to the same standards, which can cost you more in the long run. When you purchase gearing with the Spicer name, you can rest assured that you are getting quality product that's engineered to keep your vehicle on the road. Reduce your downtime and cost with genuine Spicer OE products.]]></sales_desc>
