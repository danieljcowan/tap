		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The same great quality of the RetraxPRO, now comes in a powerful textured, matte black powder coat finish. RetraxPRO MX bed covers are made with heavy-duty aluminum slats covered in a matte powder coat, giving them the strength to support distributed loads of more than 500 pounds! The RetraxPRO MX features a limited lifetime warranty, meaning you'll never have to worry about your bed cover once you have it installed. Sealed ball-bearing rollers are mounted onto each section. This allows the retractable cover to open and close easily with one hand, without the need for pull straps, Velcro, snaps or springs. Ball-bearings provide smooth operation, preventing the cover from binding when opening or closing. Retrax's patented low-profile design is always flush, enhancing the integrity of your truck's style rather than overcoming it. Your cover will seal tight and look good. Unlike soft covers that bulk up when rolled, the flush front cover streamlines the overall appearance and provides a firm, dependable seal that keeps out the elements and helps keep the bed dry. The RetraxPRO MX cover can be latched or key locked in any position. This allows for unlimited flexibility in hauling almost any object, and the secure Dual Latch Locking System provides protection unlike any other cover.]]></sales_desc>

Therefore this part is NOT recommended for use with the stock crossover (or  inchY inch link) type steering linkages.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[For the 2011 year model, Jeep significantly upgraded the Wrangler JK's interior. Unfortunately, this means that Daystar's popular Switch Panel for the older Wrangler JK no longer works. So, the engineers at Daystar set out to design an all new switch panel that would work in the new Wrangler JK's interior. Daystar's all Switch Panel places up to 5 rockers switches for running compressors, winches, lights, etc. in the ideal location, right in front of the shifter. Plus, installation is simple and utilizes the factory clips. The all NEW Daystar Switch Panel matches the 11-12 JK's dash texture and is available in two colors, black (BK) and tan (TN). Twenty Amp marine-grade rocker switches are available separately. Kit Includes 1 red, 1 blue, 1 amber & 1 green switch. 4 switch panel;Factory fit and finish]]></sales_desc>

The Brawler Bar is supported by a pair of beefy gussets, CNC laser cut from 1/4" thick plate steel.<br>The Crawler Front Bumper is installed without cutting or altering the Jeep's frame rails.

		<long_desc><![CDATA[Frame mounted for strength without stress to body or bumper;Single-action opens and closes with Jeep's tailgate;Compatible with Crawler and Bruiser series rear bumpers;Concealed heavy duty pivot with tapered roller bearings;SpyderShell Armor Coat finish with 5-Year Warranty;<b>California Residents: <a href=/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Poison Spyder's JL Frame Mounted Tire Carrier is the ultimate combination of strength, ease of use, high clearance and great looks. It attaches directly to the strongest structure on the Jeep: the frame. This removes the weight and stresses of large, heavy spare tires and wheels from the Jeep's tailgate, body tub, and bumper. The single-action opening is the pinnacle of convenience, requiring only a single hand to open the tailgate and tire carrier in tandem. The concealed pivot tucks in closer to the Jeep's body, providing better clearance on the trail. This carrier is compatible with Poison Spyder Bruiser and Crawler series rear bumpers for the Jeep JL Wrangler, and can be added later. The SpyderShell Armor Coat finish carries a 5 year warranty.<br>Frame-mounting provides the ultimate strength for a pivoting spare tire mount on Jeeps. Body mounted tire carriers place the weight and stress of the spare tire on the Jeep's tailgate and/or body. Bumper-mounted tire carriers are better, switching those forces to the bumper, which is in turn bolted to the frame. But the ultimate strategy is to go right to the source of the Jeep's structural integrity: bolt it right to the frame. The Poison Spyder JL Body Mounted Tire Carrier does just that, using a triangulated mounting bracket that secures to the Jeep's frame rail and rear crossmember in three planes.The Frame Mounted Tire Carrier's Single-Action-Opening feature is a huge convenience for when you're trying to open the tailgate and tire carrier with one hand, when you've got an armload of gear or groceries in the other. Rather than latching to itself, the Frame Mounted Tire Carrier is tethered to the tailgate so that they open and close in tandem. A custom designed tie-rod assembly, bumper mechanism and tailgate plate keep the two pieces perfectly aligned when open, but tight and rattle-free when closed.<br>The JL Frame Mounted Tire Carrier is compatible with Poison Spyder Bruiser and Crawler series rear bump]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The JL Bruizer front bumper for JL is a grille-width, high clearance bumper with recessed winch mounting. This bumper is fabricated from 3/16 plate steel, CNC laser-cut and precision brake-formed into a low profile, high clearance design for optimum off-road performance. The ends of the bumper extend far enough to protect the lower corner of the JL grille, but not far enough to hinder tire clearance or tire access to vertical obstacles. This product is finished in black with Poison Spyder's proprietary SpyderShell Armor Coat process.<br>Bruizer series bumpers are fabricated from 3/16" plate steel, CNC laser-cut and precision brake-formed into a low profile, high clearance design. The ends of the bumper extend far enough to protect the lower corner of the JL grille, but not far enough to hinder tire clearance or tire access to vertical obstacles.<br>A Winch may be installed into a heavy-duty winch mount cradle that is separate from the structure of the Bruizer bumper shell. This provides maximum mounting strength for the winch, while also locating it as low as possible within the bumper shell. The recessed winch provides unimpeded airflow through the Jeep's radiator at highway speeds, and keeps the weight of the winch as low as possible to achieve a Low Center Of Gravity. Your winch fairlead mounts directly to the integrated fairlead mount on the front of the bumper, eliminating the need to purchase a separate fairlead mount. The Bruizer bumper is compatible with most Warn, Smittybilt, and other brand winches that use the popular 10" x 4.5" mounting pattern,, including Warn ZEON series winches up to model 10S. (Poison Spyder ZEON Winch Spacers are not necessary with this bumper).<br>The Brawler Bar is modeled after the bar found on our original RockBrawler front bumper.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Race proven by best in class off-road racers for over 14 years! At Bartact & Bull Strap, we use only heat-treated 4130 chromoly end pieces and 100% made in USA mil-spec resin treated 7,000 lb nylon webbing in a full quad wrap configuration, so you have 2 full layers around each buckle.<br><br>Bartact does not skimp on quality...EVER! Made from 4 Layers of 7,000 lb webbing (28,000 lb strength total, but load limit due to thread stress is approximately 14,500 breaking strength) with heavy duty enamel-coated heat-treated 4130 chromoly hardware, and high grade nylon thread, Bull Strap limit straps are made to last and to hold up much better than flimsy single or sound layer straps with hardware not even half the strength. Beware! Other made in China straps have copied Bartact's stamp with the '4130 Heat Treated', but those end pieces break at roughly 5,500 lbs. Bartact's buckles are rated for over 12,500 lbs, but consistently hold up to over 15,000 lbs before breaking.<br><br>Bull Strap (a division of Bartact) straps, ropes, bags, & tie downs are the highest quality & top-of-the-line in the off-road industry and are proudly made in the USA. Bartact makes sure to use top-rated hardware and webbing, and refuse to use the 'cheap stuff'...so you can say goodbye to your cheap limit straps and upgrade to Bartact.<br><br>Note: when ordering, length of strap is distance between center of hole to center of hole.  Nylon is meant to stretch slightly to keep a smoother transition. Strap stretch depends on multiple variables, including weight, wet conditions, etc, but on most applications, you should factor roughly an inch of stretch for every foot of strap.]]></sales_desc>
