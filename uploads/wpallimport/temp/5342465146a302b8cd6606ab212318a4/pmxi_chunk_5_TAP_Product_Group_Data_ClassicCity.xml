		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Introducing the highest quality, most thought out Multi-Cell Flashlight holder in existence. You could settle for a cheap Chinese holder that comes in black only with a tiny piece of 1 hook and loop that you pray is stitched on and won't fall off...or you could get Bartact universal 2-cell, 3-cell, 4-cell holder, which is proudly made in the U.S.A. - Did we mention, you have your choice of colors for no extra charge? That's right! Match your Flashlight Holder to the color of your vehicle, and/or any Bartact or Trek Armor seat covers and accessories. This fits both padded and non-padded roll bars, and PALS webbing as a MOLLE accessory...so no matter how you roll, you're covered!<br><strong>Color warranty note:</strong> coyote, olive drab, acu camo, and multicam are U.S. made cordura nylon, and the same fabric Bartact uses for military products. However, due to the fact that these are nylon, it is not possible to add UV inhibitors in the milling of the fabric, so there is no 3 year anti-fade warranty on those colors."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Bartact Headrest covers feature the same fabric with 1/4 foam padding and high grade backing as Bartact seat covers to protect your seats underneath.  Proudly Made in the U.S.A.  Waterproof-backed fabric means water can only penetrate the covers at the stitching on the edges.  Bartact materials do not stretch and are much more strong and resilient than neoprene, while still giving a snug fitment, since that is one of the most important aspects of a good cover.  We also kept the 1/4" high grade foam and scrim backing in order to protect your seats underneath.  Buying loose seat covers without padding leaves you prone to seat wear from the seat covers sliding around.  You don't have to worry about that with any Bartact products."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Black Rhino Chase is the latest lightweight Rotary Forged offering for 5-lug and 6-lug truck wheels and SUV wheels. 17 inch sizes start at 24 pounds per wheel with a load rating of 2,250 lbs/wheel. For heavy duty applications, the Chase is also offered with a load rating of 2,450 lbs/wheel with wheel weights starting at 25 pounds per wheel. This results in weight savings up to 25% compared to identical sizes from the competition's wheels. All sizes are available with 8.5, 9", and 9.5" widths. Standard finishes are Matte Black and an all new Brushed Gunmetal finish. <br><br>The Chase Rotary Forged Wheel is manufactured using a highly advanced production technique called Rotary Forging. The rim of the wheels is forged at high pressure while the wheel is spun at high speed. This alters the molecular structure and enhances the strength of the alloy. The benefit is a much lighter weight than a regular cast wheel. Most importantly, the weight saving is in the outer rim of the wheel which dramatically reduces rotational mass and enhances vehicle performance."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Temperature range and overall friction value are the primary considerations for pad selection. The pads must be capable of maintaining the proper amount of friction for stopping power within the temperatures that will be realized on the track during the event. Then, overall wear rate must be considered. For most asphalt and road race applications, compounds in the high temperature ranges over 1000F range are usually necessary. Dirt track, drag race, and street performance applications usually operate at temperatures between 500 and 1000F. Keep in mind that these are general ranges, and not absolute values. Many factors and unforeseen influences can affect brake temperatures. The best indicator for pad selection will always be on track performance. If pad fade (friction loss) due to overheating occurs, then improved cooling, a heavier rotor, or a higher temperature range pad may all become necessary.]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Tired of outings ruined by belt failures?<br><br>The Assault Industries Cobra Cooler is a coolant injection system that works to reduce clutch housing temperatures by as much as 50F. Keeping temperatures down can dramatically reduce the risk of belt failures.<br><br>At the flip of a momentary switch, the system injects distilled water into the clutch housing air intake tube as a fine mist intermittently over the course of 90 seconds. Temperatures will immediately begin to drop until the system shuts off.<br><br>Temperatures will climb back up over the next several minutes. Operation is recommended when housing temperatures reach 195F which is approaching critical. <br><br>Since clutch components are aluminum, corrosion is not a factor. The Cobra Cooler will not flood the housing or cause belt skipping as it is not enough moisture. The housing temperatures will also cause a certain amount of evaporation, so while the vehicle is in use, there should be little to no standing water inside the housing. This system is designed to save your belt, clutches and housing from being destroyed by an imploding belt. Clutch/belt housing and its internal components should still be routinely maintained along with everything else on the vehicle for maximum performance and longevity.]]></sales_desc>

The end result is improved shift quality, increased clutch holding capacity, reduced friction and extended transmission life. What's more, BD's Dodge valve bodies allow for second gear lock-up-a great feature for slowing heavy loads down steep grades (TowLoc/TorqLoc required). Add longevity and performance to your transmission, while making your truck fun to drive.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Westin Platinum 4 inch Oval Wheel-to-Wheel Step Bars offer truck owners a commercial grade quality step surface that spans the length of the vehicle and features a third step area to facilitate access to the truck bed. They feature a unique patent pending Isolator Bracket that supports the step bar past the truck cab on long bed applications, a feature that competitors do not offer. Without an Isolator Bracket, the step area that extends past the vehicle cab is left unsupported. Additionally, Westin's Isolator Bracket bushings act as a cushion for the natural flexing and independent movement that occurs between the cab and the bed mounts during driving, thus eliminating squeaking. Applications are no-drill and that's just another reason why installers prefer Westin!]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Nitto Exo Grappler AWT (All Weather Traction) is built to meet the all-weather demands of off-road truck enthusiasts. Whether their journey takes them through off-road trails, gravel, or farmland, the Exo Grappler AWT is built for 4-seasons of 4-wheeling. Featuring an all-new chip resistant all-weather compound, 3-ply sidewall construction, and large, thick sidewall lugs, the Exo Grappler AWT provides armor for the elements. The gear shaped block edges reinforce center tread blocks and provide a stable contact patch. They also help reduce stone retention and stone drilling. With computer analyzed tread block arrangement that reduce tire noise normally heard at highway driving speeds. The staggered shoulder blocks provide biting edges for off-road traction in loose dirt surfaces. The 3-ply sidewall with large sidewall lugs offer additional sidewall strength and puncture resistance. Each Grappler has two sidewall designs so you can choose how your tires look. On the Exo Grappler one side has three-dimensional butresses and the other has Y-shaped butresses. This feature was an engineering feat since even a small weight imbalance can cause unwanted vibrations. Nitto produces exceptionally uniform off-road tires even with different designs. A special mix of natural rubber, high strength polymers, and wear resistant materials aids cut and chip resistance on unpaved gravel roads. Spiral shaped stone ejectors serve to reduce stone retention, as well as stone drilling. Rated with the 3-peak mountain snowflake for winter driving conditions, the Exo Grapplers sipes and large lateral grooves provide biting edges as well as water and snow/slush evacuation. These tread features are combined with a new durable compound that allows for traction in freezing temperatures. For additional traction, option TSMI #15 studs can be added for increased winter traction.]]></sales_desc>
