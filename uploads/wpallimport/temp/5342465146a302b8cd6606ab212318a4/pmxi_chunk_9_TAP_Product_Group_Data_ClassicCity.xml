		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Skyjacker Softride Technology enhances every steely aspect of leaf spring performance, giving you all the vigorous off-road handling needed while providing the smooth street riding characteristics that you demand. Skyjacker Softride leaf springs use only American steel and the individual leafs of each spring are shotpeened with hard steel pellets at very high velocities. This shotpeening compresses the surface of the steel thereby increasing the tensile strength of the spring. Without this shotpeening procedure, the maximum wheel travel and ride quality could not be achieved without sacrificing the life of the spring. Skyjacker Softride Springs use ''bolt'' style spring clips, eliminating friction. Other spring designs use the ''cinch'' style bend clips which bend tightly over the spring leafs causing binding and friction. Skyjacker Softride springs taper over the entire width of the leaf creating more flex at the leaf ends. This tapering distributes loads more evenly over a greater area and reduces the tendency for one leaf to dig into the leaf above it.]]></sales_desc>

When unlocked, there is zero resistance on the sway bar and it moves freely throughout the suspension travel cycle.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[One of the biggest problems with camping chairs on the market today is that they are built to meet a price point which effectively means they are not built to last. So when ARB started looking for a camp chair, number one on the list of priorities was strength and durability. They looked to individually test many chairs and after several months we found the design that could stand up to the task. For extra strength and added comfort, They specified a chair that had aluminum arm rests and was slightly larger than the standard chairs on the market, but still compact enough to be folded and packed in a carry bag. For extra strength and packability, this chair features locking tabs to keep the chair folded when packed and locked for additional strength when assembled. Satisfied with the strength and durability. ARB is pleased to offer a chair that can stand up to the rigorous demands of thier customers.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[With seating for 5 and outstanding rugged performance, the JK Jeep Wrangler Unlimited (4-door) is a capable vehicle on and off road. It gives owners plenty to smile about but throws up some challenges when considering storage. In order to make the most of the JK?s cargo area and maximize storage and flexibility of use, a new roller drawer module has been developed. The ARBRDRF790 incorporates a single Roller Drawer and an integrated Roller Floor top. The design allows for plenty of accessible and secure storage in the drawer. While the roller drawer function is self-explanatory, the roller floor provides easy access to a Fridge Freezer or other gear. The 37 quart ARB Fridge Freezer (ARB10800352) can be mounted in the traditional front to back orientation. Although a tight fit, a 50 quart ARB Fridge Freezer (ARB10800472) can be oriented left to right across the drawer and rolled rearwards for easier access.]]></sales_desc>

The ported shroud design of the A356 aluminum housing utilizes a 4.0 inch inlet and OE v-band outlet. The compressor wheel measures 58/76mm. The CNC machined wastegate actuator is mounted to the integrated cast bracket. The internally wastegated, high silicone ductile iron housing has an A/R of 0.84.

The larger than OE turbine wheel measures 74/64mm. The wastegate comes preset to 40 psi.The included ductile iron exhaust elbow allows this turbo to be installed on 1994-2002 model years. All connections to the vehicle are compatable with the OE geometry, resulting in a quick and reliable connection. Additional fueling is not required for improved performance over OE, but maximum gains are achieved from fuel system upgrades, either electronic or mechanical.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[It's one thing to be Made in USA. It's another to be given the time, quality, and craftsmanship only RH4x4 offers. Each front bumper is laser cut from 1/4 steel to live up to it's lifetime guarantee and give you precise fitment. It's then bent and formed into it's shape, hand welded, and ground down for a look no other manufacturer (overseas or domestic) can offer. Each bumper is then powder coated in house, by hand, individually - so every nook and cranny is protected. The inner structure is a geometry test of gussets and support. We sleep soundly at night knowing RH4x4 customers can play off road, winch recover, tow, and do-all with our armor installed, then rinse and repeat.Our bumper is more than a plate of steel, it's a fully loaded road armor upgrade bolted to the front of your Jeep. With standard included upgrades like double welded recovery shackle tabs and straight to the frame horn mounting - our bumpers scream Premium. Maybe that's why they are such head turners. When you see a RH4x4 front bumper on the trail - you just get it.This bumper uniquely hugs your frame as closely as possible giving you maximum approach angle for extreme off road adventures.It's been known to take longer to uninstall your OEM front bumper than it takes to install our front bumper. This is achieved through our unique "DTF" or Direct-to-Frame mounting method. This gives us not only a precise mounting location to your frame horns it also makes for the most secure way to mount your bumper. Plus, unlike overseas produced bumpers with a "one size misfits all" approach, we don't cut any corners when it comes to one of the most important upgrades you can add to your Jeep.RH4x4 Front Bumpers are very recognizable for two major reasons: owners bragging about how strong it is and it's innovative features that come standard. What makes up a RH4x4 bumper is what makes them so strong."]]></sales_desc>

Unlike most performance brake pads EBC Yellowstuff Pads do not require warm up to perform at its best, making Yellowstuff great for everyday street use as well. If you own a truck or SUV and want a good pad for towing than the EBC high friction Yellowstuff Pads are perfect for that as well. NOTE when shopping for both front and rear brake pads it is recommended that the same compounds are used. Each compound has unique stopping characteristics and putting different compounds on the front and rear of your vehicle could compromise the performance of one or both sets of brake pads. Professional installation is recommended for all brake pads to ensure your safety and the safety of others.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Upon deceleration, the turbo exhaust gas drive pressures are reduced, resulting in reduced turbo rpm and boost pressures. When throttle is reapplied, turbo drive pressure has to be built up, and the result is turbo lag or that ?fall on your face? feeling. The turbine diverter valve directs exhaust gases into one volute of the turbine housing to achieve enough drive pressure to accelerate the turbo. By utilizing only one volute, less volume of exhaust gas is required to build drive pressure in the single volute passage of the turbine housing; therefore, the turbine wheel assembly rpm increases quicker which reduces turbo lag, faster spool up and acceleration. Once optimal boost pressure is achieved, the second volute in the turbine housing opens up for full power and less turbine restriction. Dual volute turbine housings allow the diverter valve to utilize just one or both of the volutes to maintain turbo pressure at different engine RPM?s. The turbine diverter valve is controlled by boost pressure for precise performance.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[There's a lot that goes into lifting a truck or SUV the right way. For certain vehicles, this involves correcting the angle of the drive shaft. When the front end is raised, the transfer case goes with it. Unfortunately, this lifts the drive shaft to a steep angle, causing annoying vibration throughout the vehicle. Plus, stress on the slip yoke can cause the rear shaft to snap. Skyjacker's Slip Yoke Eliminator Kit solves the problem with a fixed yoke, 32-spline output shaft that can stand-up to off-road and on-road rigors. It also increases drive shaft length by 4.5 inch, stopping vibration and stress.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Not just a quick wash and a coat of wax on the old 10110, the new 10150 Direct Fit 1976-1986 Jeep CJ harness has undergone a complete ?frame off? restoration. The new and improved harness addresses many issues that occasionally came up when trying to install the previous version. Now included is a fully integrated ground circuit that connects directly to the negative side of the battery and provides a clean ground source to every component, as well as offering individual wires to help ground the dash and core support. This is a key addition for those using fiberglass bodies. The charging system wiring has also been improved, now using 6 gauge charge wire and an inline 100 amp fuse, allowing hassle free usage of high amperage alternators. No more sourcing larger charge wire, piggybacking additional wire, or sourcing a larger inline fuse or fuse holder. The new 10150 comes out of the box capable of supporting a 150 amp alternator. The biggest improvement to this harness is the all new full color instruction manual. This manual provides 140+ pages of color schematics, photos, and step by step instructions to wiring your CJ from headlight to tail light and covers most popular aftermarket add-ons as well.]]></sales_desc>

There is nothing more inconvenient than switching back and forth between a few different ball mounts and trying to remember which mount fits with which trailer. A CURT adjustable ball mount is your multipurpose towing solution. Its key feature is its adjustable design that takes the form of an adjustable channel-style mount or adjustable shank. Both use a series of holes to allow the ball mount to be vertically adjusted and allow for significant flexibility in drop and rise. With a variable ball height, CURT adjustable ball mounts can easily accommodate different coupler heights and multiple trailers. This particular adjustable ball mount is considered a class 3 ball mount and comes with an adjustable shank. It features a gross trailer weight capacity of 5,000 lbs. and a tongue weight rating of 500 lbs. Unlike other adjustable ball mounts that have fixed trailer balls, this one comes with a trailer ball platform with a 1 inch ball hole, allowing it to readily accept the trailer ball of your choice. With its 1 1/2 inch adjustment increments, this class 3 adjustable ball mount has a maximum drop of 7 1/4 inch and a maximum rise of 6 1/4 inch. It also features a total length of 12 1/2 inch. All CURT adjustable ball mounts come with a 2 inch x 2 inch shank and are made with sturdy steel construction. For long-lasting rust, scratch and UV resistance, they also come with our gloss black powder coat finish to give you peace of mind for the road ahead.]]></sales_desc>

CURT quick plug harnesses install in less than 10 minutes to get you setup and on your way with time to spare. They include two feet of wire and a slit loom sleeve to keep wires well protected and contained.<br></br>This brake control adapter harness is compatible with certain Ford Bronco full-size SUVs and Ford F-Series full-size trucks.
