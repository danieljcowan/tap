		<sales_desc><![CDATA[This linear light bar is the legendary flagship E-Series light bar treated to a gentle arc, creating a curve in a 20-54" extruded aluminum housing and packed full of Rigid Industries Spot LED technology to produce an astonishing custom look for any car, truck or offroad vehicle. The RDS-Series is the apex of form and function. Rigid Industries RDS-Series is another first for the LED lighting industry and has been in testing and pre-production for the last two years and was first tested by BJ Baldwin as seen on his trophy truck at Parker 425 in February 2012. Since that time, Rigid Industries' engineering team has been through numerous design changes, incorporating multiple patent pending utility and design features. The RDS LED light bar transforms the rectangular light bar Rigid Industries created, which became a phenomenon in 2006, to give this futuristic design sleekness and offer its customers an increased light spread. The world is curved, match it."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Baja Bench suspension seat was designed for enthusiasts who want the safety of suspension and the comfort of Corbeau. We integrated our state-of-the-art suspension system with the comfort and design that Corbeau is so well know for and from that came the Baja Bench suspension seats. With our custom brackets, the Baja Bench is a direct bolt in to most CJ and YJ Jeeps (Bracket part number B36001), and early Broncos (Bracket part number C22201). We also have a universal Baja Bench Adapter bracket that with minor drilling will allow the Baja Bench seat to fit in almost any other application, as long as the floor is flat and there is sufficient space. We do not recommend this seat be used in places where a seat was not intended by the orginal manufacture of the vehicle. The Baja Bench comes standard with vertical tabs on the bottom for mounting to a roll cage. If you plan on mounting to a flat surface you will need to order the Baja Bench universal bracket. All Corbeau bench suspension seats are available with an adjustable headrest. This headrest adjusts both up and down and forward and back for ultimate comfort. The Baja Bench off-road suspension seat is available in all vinyl or vinyl/cloth materials. The Baja Bench seat is available in sizes 36, 40" and 42"."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Baja JP suspension seat is basically the same seat as our well-known Baja SS seat. The main difference between the two seats, aside from the stitch pattern and dual harness slots, is the Baja JP is flat on the bottom as opposed to vertical tabs. This allows it to bolt on Corbeau brackets or a flat mounting surface without having to order a Baja Adapter. In addition, the Baja JP is a direct bolt in to most Jeep CJ5's, and all CJ7's and YJ's. Please note, the stock CJ brackets are at an angle, which means when the JP is bolted to the stock brackets, it puts the seat at an extreme angle. We recommend our custom CJ brackets unless you are okay with the seat back being at an extreme recline. The Baja JP will fit in any other vehicle with Corbeau custom brackets. Like all Corbeau suspension seats, the Baja JP is equipped with the state of the art Corbeau suspension system. This system has proven to provide superior cushioning and significant energy return upon impact. The suspension system creates somewhat of a trampoline affect, which absorbs the impact your back would otherwise endure. The Baja JP is available in all black vinyl and vinyl/cloth materials. The Baja JP will fit up to a 38 inch waist and the Wide will fit up to a 42 inch waist. You will notice the overall width of the Baja JP Wide is actually narrower then the regular Baja JP, this is not a typo. When we say wide we mean it will fit a wider driver. The Baja JP Wide has less aggressive bolsters making it a better fit for larger drivers but is indeed an overall narrower seat.]]></sales_desc>

In the 2Low position the 4WD dash light will illuminate indicating you are in a low range gear. The new shift pattern is: 2H > 4H > N > 2L > 4L]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[For use with a 4.0L 6 cylinder engine. 4.0L engines are tuned lean from the factory, adding an adjustable fuel pressure regulator is simple to install and will gain 4hp and 7 ft pounds of torque. When used in conjunction with high-flow throttle body horsepower and torque gains can reach 7 and 10 respectively. New regulator is preset at 44 pounds (stock is approx 40) and is a direct replacement for factory regulator located on the fuel rail. Cap is machined billet aluminum. Both the high-flow throttle body and fuel pressure regulator can be used with the Mopar Fuel Injection system. 258 and 4.0L 6 cylinders bored oversize or with performance camshafts may require adjustable fuel pressure regulator to achieve adequate fuel supply.

When used in conjunction with high-flow throttle body horsepower and torque gains can reach 7 and 10 respectively. New regulator is preset at 44 pounds (stock is approx 40) and is a direct replacement for factory regulator located on the fuel rail. Cap is machined billet aluminum. Both the high-flow throttle body and fuel pressure regulator can be used with the Mopar Fuel Injection system. 258 and 4.0L 6 cylinders bored oversize or with performance camshafts may require adjustable fuel pressure regulator to achieve adequate fuel supply.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[JK Cowl Induction Hoods with side vents Our cowl induction hood is not only stylish but fully functional. Made from a special blend of high impact polycarbonate plastic and is extremely durable. The material is formed at very high temperatures. 300 plus degrees. The hood is a clamshell design with a full internal structure. The same material is used on commercial buses and is also used on over the road commercial trucks.    The hood is designed to direct in outside ambient temp air from the rear of the cowl through a sealed internal duct system and delivers the cooler air to the air box.    The side vents exhaust the under hood heat that builds up toward the rear of the engine compartment. This is the most efficient location for the vents. When the vehicle is being driven the air passing by the vents and helps pull the hot air from the engine compartment by creating a vacuum. We also designed the hood to be functional and not let water or debris get into the engine compartment.    Due to the nature of the material that the hood is made from paint bonds to the plastic better than metal or fiberglass.]]></sales_desc>

Led by head engineer and SCORE champion driver Dylan Evans, ICON Vehicle Dynamics has the unique qualities to design and build the highest quality suspension components and test them in both real world applications as well as race conditions.<br><br>We are often asked how ICON develops such revolutionary performance suspension systems. The answer might surprise you. Our engineers actually start by determining a desired outcome of the vehicle they are working on. By studying forces and their effect on the vehicle in motion (Vehicle Dynamics) they are able to determine what improvements can be made. They determine how they can improve drivability of the vehicle, how to improve the handling characteristics and what changes can be made to improve the vehicle in real world situations. The end result of all this study is the highest quality and performing suspension products in the world. What also sets ICON products apart is our incredible commitment of time and energy dedicated to both ride development and testing. From vehicle dynamic theory to our years of experience and involvement in off road racing, rock crawling and just about anything you can do with a vehicle on or off the road. Our engineers are in control and the driving force of our entire product line and manufacturing processes. This is made possible because all of our laser cutting, metal forming, CNC machining, welding and assembly is done in house. With a reputation built on quality, performance, and service it's clear that ICON Vehicle Dynamics is the top choice for performance suspension systems and shock absorbers for the most popular trucks and SUV's on the market.]]></sales_desc>

This Recovery Strap is rated at 24,250 lbs. capacity, and the loop ends are protected with a nylon sheath. The strap is dyed black to easily identify it as Poison Spyder quality, sewn with red thread, red loop end protectors and red protective sleeves, labeled with the Poison Spyder logo.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[<br>Poison Spyder Customs RockBrawler is the bumper of choice for the wheeler who wants pure hardcore function coupled with a brawny attitude. The RockBrawler is fabricated from 3/16 inch high pressure steel plate, CNC laser cut and brake-formed for a precise fit. The Stinger is made of 1.75 inch  X .120 wall DOM tubing, and extends inside the bumper shell to the inner braces for added strength.<br><br>The two D-ring shackle mounts are CNC-machined from 1 inch plate steel to provide brute strength for the most demanding recovery operations. Speaking of recovery, the integrated winch mount accepts most major manufacturer's winches up to 15,000 lbs. capacity, including the innovative Warn PowerPlant with integrated air compressor. The winch fairlead plate is flawlessly integrated into the bumper design, and doubles as gusseting for the Stinger, complete with Poison Spyder's signature oval lightning holes. Recessed light mounts are provided for retention of the factory fog lamps or aftermarket off-road lamps of your choice, and protect each one in a deep well of cold hard steel.<br><br>Another characteristic of the RockBrawler is its amazing tire clearance. The bumper has faceted ends that angle inward, giving your Jeep the ultimate in clearance for large tires, even under maximized suspension movement, and during full turn scenarios. The angled sillouhette of the bumper ends allow for this tire clearance while still protecting the lower corner of the Jeep's grille. The RockBrawler's removable lower cover has an integrated skid plate for protecting the front sway bar disconnect mechanism. Jeep JK models that are not equipped with the factory sway bar disconnect can still utilize this lower skid as added protection for the front end components. The fasteners for this cover/skid, as well as all external fasteners provided with the RockBrawler, are stainless steel flat-head cap screws for a flush surface and protection from the rocks.<br>]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[If you are looking to put your power to the pavement, you need our F3 Torque Converter. Torque converters are responsible for transferring engine power to the transmission. Single clutch OE torque converters can slip and increase transmission fluid temps. As you add engine performance parts like intakes, manifolds, etc. the factory torque converter?s stall RPM rises thus reducing the available low RPM pulling power. This is where the F3 torque converter comes in. Installing the F3 torque converter will lower your stall speed to as low as 1,200RPM giving you the perfect range for diesel trucks up to 1,000hp. The results of using an F3 torque converter are improved 0-60mph times (by up to 1-second), increases in towing speeds, lower transmission fluid temperatures and a more satisfying driving experience.]]></sales_desc>

Focused in the design department is in the fit and ease of installation which mean bolt-on billet grilles with less tools and no cutting which in turn equals more productivity. When it comes to manufacturing a quality product, it starts in the design department but it doesn't end there. T-Rex starts with solid stock of aircraft quality T-5 or T-6 billet aluminum rather than extruded aluminum as used by some competitors. Every billet grille is treated to a durable glossy powder-coat.

The long arms provide a foundation of proper suspension geometry so you can add coilover shocks to achieve greater speed and ride comfort on the trial.The advantages of coilover shocks include increased wheel travel, optimized shock dampening and the ability to customize spring rates to suit your specific needs. FOXs threaded shock bodies make it easy to fine tune ride height for even more customization. Dual coil springs result in a progressive spring rate that is comfortable on the street and over small bumps on the trail while still providing stability and control over large obstacles. Remote reservoirs increase fluid capacity for cool, consistent shock damping. Rubicon Express coilover mounts are made in the USA from plate steel to maximize clearance.]]></sales_desc>

By combining the soft top and roof rack, owners can experience a Jeep to its full potential for camping, off-roading, or any lifestyle hobby they may have. This new top also features an innovative Sun Slider retractable function which allows the top to slide back with the release of just two latches, creating an open-top experience for owners without the hassle of getting out of the driver seat. Integrated into the 300-lb. capacity roof rack is an advanced externally suspended soft-top design that fastens using a series of Velcro straps along the perimeter bars of the roof rack. The pulling force applied by the Velcro helps to tighten and shape the soft top. Offered for both the two and four-door configurations, the Exo-Top features a patented design that is a direct bolt-on application with no drilling required for installation. Hard top owners will need the following factory soft top parts for installation. Windshield Header - 68003646AA, Tailgate Bar - 55395757AC, Tailgate Bar Retainer RH - 55395760AB and LH - 55395761AB.]]></sales_desc>

This exclusive design features axle tubes that have been offset above the housing centerline making the inner axle shafts ride near the bottom of the axle tubes rather than in the center. This repositioning of the axle tube results are an increase of 3/8in. ground clearance under the axle tubing. Trail Gear uses axle tubes made from 5/16 inch thick, high strength DOM steel tubing and engage 5/8in. farther into the center section. On top of that, there is a 360 gusset welded around the tubes on the inside of the housing to ensure unparalleled strength. The heavy-duty, press formed, 1/4in. plate steel center section shell is specially shaped to ensure a minimum of 3/4in. additional clearance under the differential. The differential mounting surface is made from inch plate steel to ensure studs can not pull out, even under heavy loads. The outer offset flanges are made from 4130 Chromoly to prevent distortion or bending. Housings are precision aligned using start-of-the-art, 3D digital imaging equipment.;<b>California Residents: <a href=/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The TeraFlex 9550 VSS is an exceptional shock absorber designed and developed specifically for a lifted Jeep Wrangler. This means you get the best extreme off-road performance and unequaled highway ride because it is engineered, valved, and tuned specifically for your Jeep. TeraFlex 9550 VSS shocks feature a proprietary in-house velocity valving that is tuned to react perfectly with TeraFlex suspension systems.  A triple-chromed rod ensures trouble-free operation, and an oil block and seal wipe the shock rod during compression to keep all internal fluids sealed and contained for extended lifetime performance, additionally,  an internal travel stop limiter minimizes the impact of over-compression.  The 9550 VSS gas shock uses a heavy duty twin-tube design construction to provide protection from trail damage, and the durable black e-dipped finish resists salt and other corrosives under the most extreme conditions. Double-welded shock eyelets reinforce and support the shock body against repeated stress from constant suspension cycling.  Premium-quality rubber bushings help to refine ride quality, Jeep specific mounting ends are vulcanized to the bushing to provide a hassle free installation. All TeraFlex 9550 VSS shocks are coverd by a limited lifetime warranty.]]></sales_desc>

This suspension system moves the leaf spring perches to the topside of the axle. The result is a net lift height increase of 5.5 inch with stock height springs. The use of stock spec springs will maintain the factory ride quality while the spring-over configuration will greatly increase the suspension flexibility, allowing room for larger tires and vastly improving the visual appeal of your Jeep. The Rubicon spring-over conversion kit gives you the components necessary to move the leaf spring perch to the top of the axle, increasing lift and flexibility. Spring-over axle lifts retain a stock-type ride quality by retaining the original leaf spring. Installation of this kit encompasses removing the original spring perches, welding of new perches, and other adjustments. A CV-type drive shaft is recommended for this application. Net lift from the conversion is minimum 5.5-inches. For greater durability, and a total of 7-inches of lift, we recommend running RE1445 and RE1444 Extreme-Duty leaf Springs.
