		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The system utilizes automotive grade approved high-power, high-temp, ultra-reliable components with a maximum 100 amp capacity! The sPOD SourceSE is a fully programmable digital CAN-Bus controlled system utilizing state-of-the-art technologies. OEM vehicle specific simple installation hardware, engineered and 100% manufactured in the United States. Features: Fully programmable Digital controlled system. Eight circuits rated @30amps @12.5vdc per circuit that are End-User friendly terminal block for attaching accessories. Expandable (Daisy Chained selectable) to up to 32 circuits with simple plug-n-play features! Low voltage cutoff (LVCO) battery protection circuit has spec voltage cutoff at 11.2 VDC with a two-minute delay before shutting down the SourceSE. This is useful when you have accessories turned on while the vehicle is not running. When the vehicle starts, the accessories can then be used again. The low voltage battery protection circuit can be turned off with the DIP switches. No more worrying about what rated fuse to install! The system will protect from 1.5 amps to 30 amps automatically. The SourceSE incorporates a failsafe self-healing fault protection system. Fuses have been eliminated (for all accessory outputs) and replaced with current-sensing MOSFETs controlled by a microprocessor. This is a great feature for low maintenance and troubleshooting. Two circuits (switches 1 and 2) have the option to be activated by an ignition switched power source (great for accessories that you DO NOT WANT to turn on unless the ignition key is on). These two circuits can be easily changed to this option by a simple DIP switch setting on the SourceSE and running a jumper wire to tap into a fuse that is only activated when the ignition is on. The same two circuits can also be used as High-Beam activated circuits by tapping into the input side of one of the headlight's high-beam circuits. We have taken care of the PWM issue with the headlight circuits. Shield receptacl"]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[POR-15 is a high performance coating designed for application directly on rusted or seasoned metal surfaces. POR-15 is non-porous and seals and protects many surfaces from water, chemicals, salt, and other corrosive contaminants. POR-15 is an effective anti-corrosive and rust preventive coating that offers superior chemical resistance due to its dense, cross-linked molecular composition and non-porous attributes.The secret lies in POR-15's curing process. Most paints dry through evaporation, but POR-15 dries faster when moisture is present. It has the opposite chemistry of ordinary paints. Now add to that POR-15's incredible hardness, toughness, and flexibility and you have a coating that is practically indestructible. POR-15 is great for auto restoration, and protecting valuable equipment against rust and corrosion. You'll be amazed at the toughness!]]></sales_desc>

For high rpm stability, a .500 inch steel shaft is supported by a sealed ball bearing and a long sintered bushing. This shaft also receives a QPQ coating for friction reduction and resistance to corrosion. A precision machined reluctor is attached to the shaft which triggers the magnetic pick-up mounted in the housing. This high output magnetic pick-up is the most accurate way to trigger your ignition. Plus, with no moving parts to wear or adjust, the pick-up is maintenancefree! Just above the pick-up is MSD?s adjustable mechanical advance assembly.

		<long_desc><![CDATA[Leave it to MSD to build an all-out performance distributor to replace the OEM GM LT1 Optispark! We machine an entire billet block of aluminum down into a precise housing that fits in place of the factory piece. Then, we fill it with a reliable new pick-up assembly, a trick timing adjustment mechanism and top it off with an all new MSD distributor cap! The pick-up is an advanced optical encoder, a different style of optical pickup than the OEM. This type of pick-up has proven to be very reliable and stable through extreme rpm and conditions. The rotor is bolted to a drive assembly that is indexed to the shaft and is stabilized through the use of a large ball bearing assembly. Once installed, you have the ability to adjust the ignition timing ? the only distributor that offers timing adjustability! An adjustment screw allows the timing to be tweaked up to +/-5?. The distributor is equipped with a fresh air vent and has an extra thick mounting surface for the cap to eliminate leaks. The distributor is supplied complete with our heavy duty LT1 Cap, Rotor and the components required for installation.;<b>California Residents: <a href=/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[The K&N 69-7063TTK Typhoon air intake system is a free-flowing, mandrel-bent aluminum tube air induction system designed to fit some Nissan Pathfinder, Altima, QX60 and JX35 models. The restrictive factory air filter and air intake housing are replaced by the K&N Typhoon air intake which is designed to dramatically reduce air flow restriction as it smoothes and straightens air flow. This allows your engine to inhale a larger amount of air than the factory air intake. More air means more usable power and acceleration throughout the engine?s RPM range. The 69-7063TTK air intake comes with a chrome topped K&N high-flow air filter and a heat shield that installs into the previous air box space. Air is directed through the intake tube into the engine?s throttle body for a guaranteed power gain. The intake tube has an attractive black powder-coat finish thats made to last and it accommodates the factory mass air sensor and crank case vent hose. The oversized cone shaped air filter can be used for up to 100,000 miles before servicing is needed depending on driving conditions. This air intake is relatively easy to install usually in 90 minutes or less using existing factory mounting points.;<b>California Residents: <a href=/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>

This will also allow you to run super long travel shocks and maintain a reasonable ride height and proper shock mounting for the best possible performance. Our kit is designed to work with 2 inch diameter coilovers (of any brand) or 2.5 inch Air shocks in 12 inch, 14 inch or 16 inch travel. This builder?s kit is the most universal on the market and can be cut and mounted in any position to best work with your particular Jeeps Engine & Suspension combination. Additionally, the compact hoop size is ideal for fitting inside the inner fender well, INSIDE the engine compartment with just a small hole up through the top of the fender well for the shock to poke up through to the upper mount. This is a great option when pushing your front axle forward (about 2+ inch) to get to the Magic 100 inch wheel base! This is a clean way to convert over (a leaf or coil spring vehicle) to coilover shocks and get that racing tubed out look! For the TJ or LJ guys, this kit allows you cut off and remove all the factory upper spring mount/bump stop bucket from the frame. This is perfect for placing the shock in virtually the optimal position for dampening performance and articulation. For you CJ or YJ guys who are not ready to convert the entire front end over to coilovers, this can also be a great way to upgrade just the upper shock mount and convert over to shock  inchhoops inch from the ugly stock mounts and install longer travel shocks and still keep the leaf springs. These mounts are made from heavy duty .120 inch thick wall tubing and include a crossbar to connect the two shock towers (over the engine) for maximum strength.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Rubicon Express spring-over axle conversion suspension system is designed for the truly adventurous off-roader and is a fabricators delight. This suspension system moves the leaf spring perches to the topside of the axle. The result is a net lift height increase of 5.5 inches with stock height springs. The use of stock spec springs will maintain the factory ride quality while the spring-over configuration will greatly increase the suspension flexibility, allow room for larger tires and vastly improve the visual appeal of your Jeep. The spring-over conversion requires welding new perches to the top of the axle. Steering modifications are required and a CV-driveshaft is mandatory. If you desire even more lift, the addition of a set of Rubicon Express Extreme-Duty leaf springs (RE1444 and RE1445) result in a total lift height of 7 inches. The spring-over axle suspension configuration will allow the use of 33 inch tires when using stock leaf springs. The fitment of even larger tires is possible with additional modifications.Steering modifications will be needed]]></sales_desc>

The weatherproof Soft Top Window Storage Bag solves these problems by holding your soft top windows, scratch-free, rolled up and strapped to one of several locations on your Jeep. <p>Your (3) windows are held inside individual pockets of the neoprene window sleeve. Neoprene is the spongy material commonly used to make wetsuits and its nonabrasive, highly protective, and water resistant qualities make it perfect for this application. The material does not pick up dirt, lint or other debris from the ground, so it is easy to keep clean. The neoprene sleeve is rolled up, buckled tight, and slid into the Window Storage Bag. <p>The Storage Bag attaches to your Jeep's roll bars, behind the rear seat headrests, or behind the front seat headrests. Quick release buckles make attaching and removing the bag a breeze. The rear window bar provides structure for the bag, keeping it from sagging or flapping in the wind.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[A bigger, bolder and more extreme mud tire, the STI R4 is specifically designed and engineered for high-performance UTV and ATV applications. The 8 ply rated, tubeless radial carcass tire measures nine inches wide. The R4 features super deep lugs 1.75 at center and 2.0" at the shoulder - angled to optimize traction performance both forward and in reverse.<br><br>This mud tire is constructed for durability too, with a rubber compound built for abuse. The R4's deep rim guard protects your wheels as well. Other tires may look the same, but only the STI R4 enters the mud with lugs this deep and a carcass this strong - and at a comparatively low weight."]]></sales_desc>

The 360 Degree adjustable ball joint locks for secure positioning and optimal viewing from almost any angle. An ambient light sensing LED ring indicates charging and adjusts intensity in light and dark settings. A thermal management gap between the charging head and your device allows heated air to escape, promoting cooler, safer charging for your device. Compatible with your iPhone, Android and most Qi compatible devices. For iPhone 11 devices, place the MagicPlates outside of your case or in between your phone and case."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Give your Jeep the ultimate off-road damping with Rough Country's Threaded Hydraulic Bump Stops. Your Jeep's factory bump stops simply aren't equipped to handle the intense force that can be applied in aggressive off-road scenarios. This pair of high-end, hydraulic bump stops feature a mixture of advanced suspension fluid and compressed Nitrogen to control the final inches of suspension travel providing a cushioned response during off-road travel. An Internal Floating Piston (IFP) in the shaft separates the oil and nitrogen to prevent cavitation.<br><br>Designed with lifted vehicles in mind, Rough Country's Threaded Hydraulic Bump Stops help prevent damage to your undercarriage by preventing your suspension from bottoming out. The result is a less jarring, more comfortable ride quality over rocky trails and uneven terrain. The threaded body allows you to adjust the mounting height to fine-tune when the bump stop engages during up travel.<br><br>Each bump stop is fully serviceable and rebuildable for a long lifespan of turbulence control.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Leave the pavement far behind, along with your sense of refinement, with a full set of Rugged Ridge Steel Tube Fenders. We engineered these fenders to really shine when there are rocks to climb, so we started with a burly 1.25-inch mandrel-bent steel tube frame. The fenders top skin was die-stamped and laser-cut from 12-gauge steel plate, rugged enough to survive a real-world bashing that would send a plastic fender to the trash pile. Stylized front plates, contoured base plates, as well as marker light brackets, are all CNC bent from 3mm thick steel, carrying out the tradition of being tougher than they need to be; while integrated amber LED corner lights keep things highway-friendly. Since the elements off-road can be as harsh as the terrain, we finished our JL Steel Tube Fenders with a durable satin black powder coat finish that resists rust and corrosion and looks civilized doing it. Add in Teflon-coated button head hardware with Nylock retainers and it's hard to find a more potent off-road combination. Plus, you can shake off another load of factory plastic when you add a set of Aluminum Front Inner Fenders (11615.61) to complete the look of your new fenders. Available in pairs for Front or Rear, and Full Sets. (Note: Some JL models equipped with LED Lighting package may require Tazer programming to remove a bulb-out dash warning)."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Rugged Ridge's innovative stamping process gives the Spartacus Rear Bumper a lightweight body and a cutting-edge style unlike anything on the market today. Stamped from sturdy 11-gauge stamped steel, the Spartacus looks perfectly striking when wandering the open road, and even better off of it. But the Spartacus clearly goes beyond looking good. A tough satin black powder-coated finish resists rust, corrosion and the elements, while integrated shackle mounts add that little bit of extra insurance you need when things get deep (standard 7/8-inch D-shackle not included). To top it off, it's designed to work with factory and most aftermarket hitches, as well as factory proximity sensor systems.  US Patent No. D760,133, D775,013, D800,036 & D776,582.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Grimlock Rotary Forged Wheel is manufactured using a highly advanced production technique called Rotary Forging. The rim of the wheels is forged at high pressure while the wheel is spun at high speed. This alters the molecular structure and enhances the strength of the alloy. The benefit is a much lighter weight than a regular cast wheel. Most importantly, the weight saving is in the outer rim of the wheel which dramatically reduces rotational mass and enhances vehicle performance.]]></sales_desc>

One solution is to use Toyota Pickup drivelines instead. Even if you have to have the Pickup shafts shortened, this is still a more economical alternative to custom-made drivelines. This option is especially appealing to anyone doing a Toyota axle swap. In that case, you likely have the driveline that came with the axle and will only need to adapt it to fit the Samurai t-case.]]></sales_desc>
