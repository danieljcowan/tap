Addictive Desert Designs has designed a universal tire carrier that will fit most modern truck beds. It is sized for up to a 40 tall and 14" wide tire. These dimensions are true measurements (actual measured height/width may vary slightly from tire manufacturer's advertised height/width). The slots cut in the front and back of the carrier support a Y-strap (2 anchor points in rear, one in front). We offer a Macs strap that fits the bill perfectly. The series of mounting holes allows you to mount it anywhere in your bed, and they are also sized to allow you to mount two of them side by side. The universal tire carrier is sold individually, not in a pair."]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[Compatible with industry standard bed rails (ISR);2-5/16 High-strength stainless steel ball;Tongue weight scale built into the ball mount platform helps you balance your trailer;Promotes safe towing  lets you know if your load needs to be adjusted before you tow;Simple operation  automatically provides a measurement every time you couple your trailer;Efficient and hassle-free  eliminates the need for separate or commercial scales;V19 & J2638 Certified;Saves lives, property & time"]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Safe Load ISR Gooseneck Ball is the one and only gooseneck hitch with a built-in scale that signals you to adjust your load before you hit the road, resulting in a much safer and enjoyable towing experience. Before this gooseneck hitch, gauging your trailer's tongue weight or pin load weight was a hassle. You had to rely on inefficient bathroom scales, make a trip to the weigh station, or purchase a separate tongue weight scale. But with the Weigh Safe's built-in scale, measuring your tongue weight is as easy as coupling your trailer to your gooseneck hitch. Simply hook-up your trailer to the Safe Load ISR Gooseneck Ball just as you would any other gooseneck hitch. The weight of your trailer will push down on the gooseneck ball, which in turn pushes down on an internal hydraulic piston that sits on a bed of oil. When the piston drops into the oil, the pressure reading is sent out to the scale.<br><br>What is tongue weight and why is it important? Tongue weight (TW) or pin load weight refers to the weight that the fully loaded trailer exerts downward on the back axle of the tow vehicle. Tongue weight is typically 15 percent  and should not exceed 25 percent  of your gross trailer weight. For example, a 10,000-lb trailer should have a tongue weight between 1,500 lbs and 2,500 lbs. You can adjust the tongue weight of your trailer by removing or adding cargo, or redistributing the load on the trailer. The tongue weight should not exceed the capacity of your tow vehicle, your hitch, or any of your towing components.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Countless hours were spent designing and refining these arms to the point where they met our high standards. CAD designing and machining gave us the ability to bring some new design elements and features to the table. We CNC machine these from aerospace quality 6061 billet aluminum, then send them out to be bead blasted, Type II anodized gun metal gray and have our Camburg logo laser etched.<br><br>Like our tubular arms we use a larger FK 1.50 uniball that has a PTFE liner for increased strength and mis-alignment for maximum useable wheel travel. Made in the USA these are far superior to the cheaper and smaller imports other companies use. Adapting the uniball to the spindle/knuckle is done using model specific spacers that match the factory taper precisely. These are machined from heat-treated stainless steel and are a one piece design for increased strength. No drilling or modifications are needed. The 1.50" uniball gives us the ability to run a larger and stronger 9/16" 12 point bolt with a low profile bolt-on uniball cap to resist the elements.<br><br>Using larger and stronger FK 7/8" chromoly heim joints allows for additional camber and caster adjustment if needed with larger 6" suspension kits or damaged frames. Using a heim joint also eliminates flexing/deflection under hard use and braking with zero binding when in use. Using AN/Mil-spec hardware we have a single pinch bolt and secondary jam nut to insure the heim is secure with the rigors of off-road use."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[With heims and uniballs you want to make sure you use the right lube and not a grease or oil that attracts dirt. Tri-flow is a teflon (PTFE) based lube that goes on wet and drys to a film to coat and seal the surfaces. This minimizes stiction and corrosion in extreme conditions. You only need to use 3-4 drops per uniball or heim.<br><br>We recommend using a microfiber towel to wipe clean the surfaces prior to applying. You can also use WD40 to help clean prior but wait 1-2 days before applying Tri-flow to allow the solvents in the WD40 to fully evaporate.<br><br>Tri-Flow Superior Lubricant is a superior, light viscosity lube that allows for deep penetration into hard to reach moving parts. The drip bottle application, with a convenient straw, allows for deep penetration in hard to reach moving parts.<br><br>High-grade petroleum oils provide optimum lubrication under extreme temperatures (-60 to 475F) and humidity. Formulated solvents soften and remove dirt and contaminants, while special additives displace moisture and prevent rust and corrosion. Formulated with P.T.F.E.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Don't be the guy who kills the ride by constantly overheating. High Lifter's Radiator Relocation Kit ensures your ATV/UTV is mud-ready all the time without having the need to constantly be stopping to cool off your engine from a clogged radiator. Nothing kills a ride worse than mud in the radiator. You're ATV/UTV is not quite broke, but it isn't running either. You and your buddies have to keep stopping over and over for you to cool off. Keep your radiator clean and your engine cool with High Lifter's Signature Radiator Relocation Kit designed especially for riders who love those deep mud holes. The High Lifter research and design team know that stock radiators were engineered to perform in a wide range of harsh conditions and terrains. The only condition manufacturers didn't design for was mud totally stopping up the cooling fins. By relocating the radiator to the front rack, you can keep it free of mud and easily access the radiator for cleaning and rinsing. High Lifter's heavy-duty relocation kits are mounted between 40-50 degrees (depending on the make and model) to deflect debris. The shrouds and mounting rack are made of 12-gauge steel and powder-coated in wrinkle black to look good on any ATV/UTV.  The precision-cut High Lifter logo on the shroud makes your ATV/UTV stand out in any crowd. If you already have snorkels, some rerouting may need to be done, but if you don't already have snorkels there is still plenty of room on the front rack to locate them in a variety of combinations. Please confirm application fitment.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Move your wheels out and get the room needed for bigger tires and more traction in any terrain with High Lifter's Wide Trac Wheel Spacers! One pair of spacers inlcuded in each box. Ever thought to yourself, Self...I sure wish my ATV / UTV was a little wider. I'd feel a whole lot safer...and I'd get a little better bite in the ruts!" High Lifter Wide Trac Aluminum Wheel Spacers are designed to move ATV wheels slightly out from the hubs and shocks. There are several major benefits provided by Wide Tracs: 1. They extend wheel width for greater stability and increased safety. Riders of tall ATVs and UTVs will feel much more comfortable on side hills with the wider base provided by Wide Tracs. 2. They provide mud tires a fresh "bite" at the side of ruts instead of the ATV / UTV simply driving down the deepest part of the center of the ruts where previous riders have been. So the problem of getting stuck by being "high centered" is reduced. 3. They allow the installation of larger, aftermarket tires without rubbing shocks, struts or exhaust systems."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[OEM springs tend to fatigue rapidly even with low mileage. The High Lifter Lift Springs were engineered to provide about 100 additional pounds of capacity (per 4 set) over the new stock springs. They were also designed to make a significant difference in the performance of your ATV with as little affect as possible on the ride and handling of the machine. And here's a big bonus, a complete set of the Lift Springs may be installed for substantially less than the cost of one replacement OEM shock. For those who ride at slower speeds, with big tires and heavier loads, the Lift Springs will be a welcome and economical upgrade. Depending on the make, model, and current modifications to the unit, the High Lifter Lift Springs have been known to add on full inch of suspension lift, however, it's not guaranteed. The Lift Springs add some stiffness to the ride and decrease roll, but have not been found harsh or uncomfortable by anyone who has ridden them. One thing is for sure. If you are a hardcore mud rider or you carry a load, your ATV could stand a heavier load capacity. The High Lifter Lift Springs are just what the doctor ordered!]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The OME engineers initial evaluation of the new Chevrolet Colorado revealed a very firm, controlled ride when configured in the OE trim. This provided the opportunity to explore tuning for comfort and control in various loading scenarios. OME's newly developed range will provide a plush ride over both on-and off-road slow speed terrain, but still provide vehicle stability when a high speed maneuverer is required. In order to accommodate for vehicles with various loads OME has developed a wide spectrum of strut and spring combinations to provide industry-leading load carrying ride comfort combination possible. <br><br>For optimal ride performance, a complete suspension systems is recommended. However, there is an opportunity to fit front coils, struts, and rear shock absorbers as a leveling kit. This configuration will accommodate a winch and bumper combination while lifting or leveling the front suspension height. A leveling kit will maintain the rear height while improving ride quality through the fitment of OME struts and shocks.<br><br>Factory geometry allows for a 1 lift and still maintains an adequate level of droop. Three spring options were chosen to cater for vehicles with factory bumper and with aftermarket bumper and winch setups. Specific kits have been developed for both gas and diesel models. In addition, a 5mm trim packer is available to assist with the fine tuning of ride heights and trimming the vehicle from side to side.<br><br>The newly-tuned strut resulted in a compliant yet controlled ride with particular improvement in isolation of small inputs and road texture as well as larger inputs from various speed bump profiles, pot holes and road features."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[In 2010, Low Range Off-Road set out to make the absolute best steering kit for the Suzuki Samurai. After 3 years of development and testing, they made their version available to the public.<br><br>Why is it the best? If you've never heard of Ackermann steering geometry, it's what prevents tires from slipping while following the path of a turn. While the factory steering system accounts for this geometry, many (if not all) of the steering systems designed for the Samurai do not.<br><br>Why would this matter? When making a turn, the proper geometry causes the inside tire to turn slightly sharper than the outside tire so that your tires do not slip or drag. This prevents the excessive tire wear generally associated with sharp turning. This also provides superior traction off-road when fully locked up or in a high traction situation.<br><br>Low Range has leveraged Ackermann steering geometry in their design by utilizing the factory steering tie rod location. A taper reamer is included in the Full Kit and the Stage II Kit to ream out your factory arm to accommodate FJ80 Land Cruiser tie rod ends. FJ80 tie rod ends are like the 1-ton joints of the Suzuki and Toyota world and use a huge 23mm thread.<br><br>They couple the FJ80 tie rod ends with 1/4 thick DOM steel tubing. Almost all other Toyota and Suzuki steering kits use a thinner tube which is not nearly as strong as 1/4" wall."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Pro Runner Monotube shocks deliver the most bang for your buck when combined with the new Pro Runner Control Arms. At the heart of the shock is the gas-charged monotube design that delivers superior performance compared to traditional twin tube shocks. The brushed and zinc-plated, clear coated monotube body is nitrogen gas pressurized to eliminate performance-robbing cavitation during compression and rebound. This allows the shock to dissipate heat more efficiently. The Vehicle Specific Ride Tuning (VSRT) in each shock was derived using extensive dyno and real world testing. The result is multi-stage valving to optimize the ride and handling characteristics for each application. Whether you are towing a trailer or hitting woops in the desert, you can count on Pro Comp Pro Runner monotubes to give you the confidence behind the wheel."]]></sales_desc>

These boatside body mounts will take you new places your factory mounts never could. Simply use normal OEM height bushings with this kit. The bushings are inserted from the back side above the frame which means the underside of the boatside doesn't need as large of a hole, giving you better clearances and less material to get hung up on.]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[To ensure compatibility, ICON is no longer offering GM 2500HD/3500HD upper control arms as individual components. Upper control arms can only be purchased in unison with ICON shock absorbers as a complete system. The included ICON Vehicle Specific (V.S.) 2.5 Aluminum Series shocks are designed and built to give your vehicle outstanding performance off-road and a smooth ride on the street. These shocks are configured specifically for each application in both length and damping tune. Like all of ICON's Shock Absorbers, the V.S. 2.5 Series shocks are 100% rebuildable and 100% revalveable. For piggyback and specific remote reservoir applications, ICON'S unique use of a 6061-billet aluminum manifold a few inches below the top cap of the shock creates an internal Bump Zone that when used creates an additional 20% of damping force. This additional force helps prevent harsh bottom outs and controls the suspension when compressing at high velocity. Remote reservoirs ensure optimum performance by increasing the duration of consistent damping regardless of situation, keeping the shocks at a cooler operating temperature during heavy use.]]></sales_desc>

No matter what the demands placed on your suspension, King can provide configuration specific bypass designs to assure complete control of high speed and low speed oscillations with our position sensitive damping. Tube quantity and location are based on our time tested standard locations or your entirely unique custom application.<br><br>Our bypass valve design and superior tube flow capacity provides accurate flow control over the whole range of adjustment. Our precise manufacturing processes and strict adherence to quality standards makes this possible. Our bypass valve springs are made out of the same material we use for our valve shims to reduce the possibility of heat induced fade compromising your settings. Shock tubes are honed after plating to assure a tight piston seal and all bypass ports are cnc drilled and hand deburred then polished. This commitment to quality and attention to detail creates enhanced flow control and unparalleled levels of precision adjustment. When you combine this level of functionality with our depth of knowledge setting up your valving and bypass settings you will enjoy enhanced car control, reduced driver fatigue and sustained peak performance. Once you experience King shocks you will know there really is a difference. Nothing rides like a King.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Quad-Sport  street, desert, trail, & crawl. The advantage and benefit of the TeraFlex Elite LCG suspension system for JK Wranglers is apparent the minute you put the pedal to the floor. With superior handling, responsive steering, ultimate off-road performance, and customizable suspension geometry, this system is miles ahead of anything else out there. TeraFlex continues to dominate the off-road market, and the Elite LCG reinforces that position. The Elite LCG suspension can handle anything you can dish out.The handling and performance of the Elite long flexarm system over any other kit, long or short, on the market is simply amazing. The long upper and lower flexarms work in tandem to provide synchronized suspension movement and articulation that does not bind or limit travel. The suspension travel is maximized through correct control arm geometry that reduces the extreme control arm angles, an inherent problem with short arm lifts. This correct geometry also eliminates most of the front-to-back movement of the axle as it cycles in its motion, keeping the wheel centered in the wheel-well through all suspension travel. The new flexarm mounting points properly address critical handling areas of anti-squat on the rear, and anti-dive on the front. A factory style 4-link suspension with track bar provides the best handling and performance for on-road drivability and allows the JK to track tight through corners and at highway speeds. The track bars provide excellent lateral stiffness to keep the axle properly centered under the vehicle for the strongest suspension configuration possible. The low center of gravity philosophy has been implemented in this system to ensure that ground clearance and suspension ability has been maximized while keeping the total center of gravity as low as possible for premium handling and control. The difference is immediate and the advantage is TeraFlex.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Rigid Industries has once again revolutionized the way the world sees at night, this time in the smallest and lightest fixture we have ever produced, the Single Row Mini. Encased in a magnesium housing, the light weighs in at an astonishing 7 ounces, including hardware. At 3 inches wide by 1.75 inches tall, the SR-M fits in the palm of your hand. The hybrid spot optic in the SR-M will project light nearly 1000; while the specter optic will produce an unbelievable 1050 raw lumens. The SR-M will also be available with a diffusion lens, a feature that separates the beam of light outwards at a 60-degree angle, allowing for brilliant area lighting. The Single Row Mini is something all of us at Rigid Industries have been dreaming about since day one, says Rigid Industries VP of Sales and Marketing, Taylor Anderson. To create an extremely compact light that is highly efficient yet remarkably bright is an engineering feat. We are very proud to say this dream is now reality and available to the public through our network of dealers and distributors. High-powered LED lighting has never come in a smaller more efficient package. The SR-M draws as low as 0.63 amps and can run on any 7 to 36 volt system. The light comes with the Rigid Industries limited lifetime warranty and world famous customer service. The Single Row Mini will also be available in Marine Grade, under our M-Series family of lights. This includes a 3 stage durable UV 3800 powder coat, ASTMB117 Salt/Fog and IP68 certifications as well as stainless steel hardware. The M-Series SR-M will be available mid to late May. A Flush Mount version of the SR-M, in both marine and standard housings, will be available in late may as well. The flush mount brings efficient lighting to applications where space or appearance is a concern. The flush mount option allows for a whole new look while also adding flexibility during installation. All you need is a flat surface and the ability to wire to it]]></sales_desc>

		<display_name><![CDATA[Trail Gear Rock Assault Axle Housings]]></display_name>
		<long_desc><![CDATA[Trail-Gear introduces a new concept to the axle housing design. This exclusive design features axle tubes that have been offset above the housing centerline making the inner axle shafts ride near the bottom of the axle tubes rather than in the center. This repositioning of the axle tube results are an increase of 3/8in. ground clearance under the axle tubing. Trail Gear uses axle tubes made from 5/16in.thick, high strength DOM steel tubing and engage 5/8in. farther into the center section. On top of that, there is a 360 gusset welded around the tubes on the inside of the housing to ensure unparalleled strength. The heavy-duty, press formed, 1/4in. plate steel center section shell is specially shaped to ensure a minimum of 3/4in. additional clearance under the differential. The differential mounting surface is made from plate steel to ensure studs can not pull out, even under heavy loads. The outer offset flanges are made from 4130 Chromoly to prevent distortion or bending. Housings are precision aligned using start-of-the-art, 3D digital imaging equipment.;<b>California Residents: <a href=/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Trail-Gear introduces a new concept to the axle housing design. This exclusive design features axle tubes that have been offset above the housing centerline making the inner axle shafts ride near the bottom of the axle tubes rather than in the center. This repositioning of the axle tube results are an increase of 3/8in. ground clearance under the axle tubing. Trail Gear uses axle tubes made from 5/16in.thick, high strength DOM steel tubing and engage 5/8in. farther into the center section. On top of that, there is a 360 gusset welded around the tubes on the inside of the housing to ensure unparalleled strength.
