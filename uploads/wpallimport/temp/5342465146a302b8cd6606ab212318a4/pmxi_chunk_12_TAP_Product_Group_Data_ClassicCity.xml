		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Is it time to rebuild your Jeep's axles or install a locking differential? Does your CJ need a frame-off restoration? If engine, transmission, transfer case, axle, steering, electrical, or metal restoration seem difficult or beyond your skills, here is the fix! Jeep expert, automotive instructor, and author of the Jeep Owner's Bible, Moses Ludel simplifies the most complex service procedures and recognizes the most popular performance upgrades.</b><br>Moses Ludel learned to drive in his parent's 1964 CJ-5 Jeep. Dirt roads soon led to rural Nevada's ghost towns, old mine sites, remote dry camping, gold prospecting, untamed trout streams and primitive hunting areas. An outdoor enthusiast devoted to off-pavement safety and low-environmental-impact use of four-wheel drive vehicles, Moses is an expert at vehicle recovery procedures, survival driving techniques and protection of a 4WD vehicle under the most challenging off-road conditions.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Flex-a-Chill delivers cooling and protection that reduces the temperature of the cylinder heads without the need of additional coolant gels. With a lower PH level (8.5) than many competing products, Flex-a-Chill is designed specifically to protect your expensive aluminum engine parts and radiator from electrolysis that corrodes the parts from the inside out. The formula also contains organic compounds that will prevent contaminates such as calcium and magnesium from developing into scales that clog your cooling system. Flex-a-Chill is a ?bubble buster? for the water in your cooling system, providing improved contact, and better contact means better heat transfer by as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit. One 12-ounce bottle treats 12-16 quarts of coolant with a minimum of 20-percent antifreeze for street applications. Race applications should double the ratio.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The second offering in the 600 Series is the MR606 Mesh. Staying true to the 600 Series philosophy, the MR606 takes the ultra clean styling of the MR306 Mesh wheel and exaggerates it. This wheel is going to be another contender for the deep dish club boasting a 3 lip on the 20x10s and 5" lip on the 20x12s. Cleaning things up a bit around the outside, the MR606 features a more conventional non-beadlock lip design while still including removable stainless steel bolts. Center cap duties are taken care of via a bolt-on aluminum center ring with a snap in cap with raised Method logo for 5 & 6 lug, while a bolt on piece will cover 8 lug applications. To hammer it home, a second Method logo is subtly debossed into one of the spokes. Don't mistake the clean and simple design for weakness, the MR606 features the same 2650 lb. load rating for 5 & 6 lug applications and 3640 lbs. for 8 lug."]]></sales_desc>

For those who are after a deep-dish look, this is going to be a contender. The 20x10 has a 3 lip and the 20x12 has a 5.25" lip.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Introducing an all new Jeep JK Bumper, the 27 Special". An aluminum, rugged and light weight design from Lange Originals. Whether you rock crawl or stick to the pavement, this aluminum bumper fits all uses. Weighing in at only 27-pounds, you will feel the better steering response and improved handling. The 27 Special is texture powder coated black for durability, appearance, and extended life. Aluminum ringed light guards offer additional protection and allow installation of your stock Jeep fog lights. High-clearance design allows for aggressive approach angles, and the use of larger tires, while providing corner protection from branches and brush. The tubular steel Grill Guard gives additional protection and has welded tabs for lighting options. The Winch Plate fits most 9000 pound winches and will even mount the winch, between the frame rails, without relocating the vacuum pump. This means a lower center of gravity which further improves handling and pull angle."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Get the best of both worlds with Rough Country's Control Arm Relocation Brackets. These durable drop brackets help reset control arm angles to a more natural and comfortable geometry. By reducing the operating angle of the front control arms, the force applied to the arm when hitting a bump is now directed up into the springs instead of being absorbed into the frame. These drop brackets allow a ride with 3.5in to 4in of lift to operate more like stock, with a more appropriate geometry to increase force on the front wheels. More force means more traction in straight line braking and reduced weight shifting and inertia when braking during a curve. Install a set of Control Arm Relocation Brackets, and gain the ultimate in lifted ride quality.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The AGM Suspension Slider or as some may refer to this part as a spring divider, is like nothing on the market today. Specifically designed for the brutal demands imposed by modern off-road vehicles, the AGM Suspension Slider provides its user with the strength and support of an aluminum slider while still allowing the smooth non-destructive operation of a molded slider.<br><br>This is accomplished through the use of a precision fit insert, made of a proprietary blend of the finest materials and a 6061 hard anodized 2-piece outer housing. In total the AGM Suspension Slider will hold suspension springs truer to each other and their respective coil carrier body. Therefore, preventing the contact that inevitably occurs when an O.E.M. slider prematurely wears, deforms or breaks, allowing the springs to deflect and contact the coil carrier body, causing damage to both. It is because of this that the AGM Suspension Slider will increase component life and could reduce related prep costs by as much as $2000.00 per race.<br><br>So whether it's racing a Trophy Truck or just having fun in the desert with a weekend toy, those who care about their vehicles and want only the best parts that are the highest in quality and craftsmanship will choose the AGM Suspension Slider.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[This SES Suspension Upgrade fits the front or rear suspensions. Timbren engineered their hollow rubber springs to deliver a progressive spring rate. In other words, the more weight that pushes down on the rubber springs the harder they work to prevent rear end sag. Whether you're pulling a trailer or carrying a heavy load in the bed of your truck, Tiimbren's hollow rubber springs adjust automatically to keep the vehicle level at all times.<br><br> This SES Suspension Upgrade replaces the jounce stop on the frame. Its unique design ensures superb ride quality  loaded or unloaded. (There should be a 1/2 to 1-1/2" gap between rubber spring and axle to ensure unloaded ride quality.) Unlike other auxiliary spring systems, the SES Suspension Upgrade guarantees the best of both worlds."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Active Off-Road Bumpstops offer off-road enthusiasts greater control over their vehicles' suspension travel. Using progressive-rate springs means that instead of a hard stop at the end of axle travel the axle energy will be absorbed when bottoming-out producing smooth, predictable and quiet axle engagement and disengagement.<br><br>Unlike the OEM bumpstops, Timbren uses superior natural rubber compound ensuring the Active Off-Road Bumpstops will continue to operate even after a lifetime of off-road abuse. Similar to our Timbren SES line, Active Off-Road Bumpstops carry a LIFETIME WARRANTY & SATISFACTION GUARANTEE.]]></sales_desc>
