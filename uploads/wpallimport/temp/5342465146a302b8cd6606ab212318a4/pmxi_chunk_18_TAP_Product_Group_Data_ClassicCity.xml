		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Complete the summer accessory package with a MasterTop Tonneau cover.  These custom rear vehicle covers protect your belongings from the weather and keep your valuables out of sight from prying eyes.  Constructed of Durable original equipment approved fabric, each Tonneau is custom fit for your Jeep and features sport bar sleeves that secure around the sport bar.  Though not completely waterproof, these durable rear vehicle covers attach to your factory belt rail/tailgate bar system and fits over your soft top hardware on 87-06 Wrangler models (will not fit 87-06 Wrangler hardtop only vehicles).  Each MasterTop Tonneau incorporates a front facing zipper attachment for use with a MasterTop Wind Stopper to create the ultimate summer soft goods combo.  All MasterTop Black Diamond Tonneau Covers use up-graded 28 oz Sail Cloth fabric for the ultimate in durability and great looks.  This is a MasterTop exclusive feature found in no other aftermarket summer soft top! Why MasterTop Tonneau Covers? In this highly competitive category, other manufacturers have reduced the quality of the fabric and designs to the point where it is almost impossible to find a Summer Accessory made with the original equipment approved fabric.  In an effort to reduce cost (and unfortunately, quality), manufacturers have all gone to an imported very low grade of fabric.  This inferior fabric does not match your soft top, rips easier and has inconsistent color and textures.  At MasterTop we continue to provide the products with the quality you have come to expect from a premium manufacturer.  We use only original equipment approved fabrics in our summer soft goods (excluding Sun Stop Mesh Products) to ensure you only get the best product available."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Samurai owners know that one of the weakest spots on their vehicle is the front axle.  The axle is suceptable to bending or warping, causing the alignment to wear tires, and the front axle components to prematurely fail.  If you plan on any off road usage, we recommend to truss your axle with our truss and gusset kit.  This is a must for all those who are planning on doing a spring over axle swap or aftermarket suspension and tire upgrades.<br><br>The factory engineers didn't plan on us putting these little things through so much abuse, that is why we make them stronger than factory... so they can take the beating and have no ill-effects from our punishment...plus, when welded to the axle it looks plain trick!]]></sales_desc>

Often a screw extractor can retrieve the broken portion of the screw so that the shaft can be removed from the head though sometimes the entire shaft needs to be replaced.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The RRD 2.0 Remote Reservoir Shock's fluted aluminum body gives the advantage of weight reduction without sacrificing strength. Which not only make this shock the lightest shock in its class, it also provides a surface area greater than most 2 inch bodied shocks. The fluting provides the structure required to ensure the aluminum cylinders are as strong, if not stronger than their steel 2.0 inch counterparts. The shock bodies are also treated with a military grade hard anodized coating so you never have to worry about corrosion. A high quality DU bearing provides the bearing surface for the massive 3/4 inch Nitrotec Steel shaft. And unlike chrome plated shafts these Nitrotec steel shafts are bare so you never have to worry about pitting or flaking potentially destroying the seals. While a billet aluminum valve circuit with digressive valving controls the dampening, redundant sealing technology keeps the shock oil where is belongs. The shock oil is formulated for fade-free dampening and smooth rebounds. Its high viscosity index and shear stability controls shock fade. This with a custom moly piston wear band greatly reduces shock body wear.All these features combine to make the RRD 2.0 Remote Reservoir Shock a fraction of the weight of the competitions 2.0 steel body counterparts and cool twice as fast for fade resistant performance. And all RRD Shocks come with a 6 month Warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The next-generation Pro Comp Beadlock Wheel is here to take on the most extreme terrain imaginable.  Available in satin black or super machined finishes, the new eight-spoke design yields a classic hardcore look. But the Pro Comp Trilogy Race beadlock wheel is way more than just a pretty face. Engineered to be a full 27% stronger than the previous version, it brings race-level performance to the masses. A completely redesigned bead ring is double the thickness of the original and forged from 6061 aircraft-grade aluminum. Fully countersunk Grade 8 bolts stay protected from rocks, impacts and abuse while NORDLOCK washers ensure that the ring hardware stays properly torqued. The new ring also uses a specialized 45-degree diamond knurl pattern while the bead area of the wheel features Pro-Comp's patented Infini-Grip figure eight pattern. Together they form a super team of grip that keeps the bead locked securely in place regardless of air pressure or impacts. Already battle tested in the harsh deserts of the Baja 1000 and the jagged rocks of King of the Hammers, the next-generation Pro Comp Beadlock wheel can be trusted to thrive in the most extreme environments. Air down and conquer with the new Pro Comp Trilogy Race Beadlock wheel.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[A huge upgrade to the G3's is the addition of the CREE XP-L chips. These new chips provide up to 50% more light output than previous models along with a wider viewing angle. The improved viewing angle effectively fills the light housings creating a sharp beam pattern with amplified coverage and distance with no dead spots. The LED drivers that come with the G3's have built in Pulse Modulation Control. This new feature eliminates the annoying flickering sensation in most vehicles when lower voltage is used in daytime running light mode. The main column on the G3 LED bulbs have been thinned down to place the LED chips closer to the location of a filament in a halogen bulb. This innovative design lets the G3 bulbs perfectly utilizes factory housings much more effectively which produces a seamless beam pattern with no dead spots or light scatter. The cooler LED chips are the longer they will work at maximum light output. The redesigned fan on the G3 LED creates a vacuum effect which delivers 70% more airflow than the previous design. The computer designed fins are placed in an exact location on the fan to keep the LEDs running cool and at optimal light output. Also, this new design cuts resonating fan noise by 40% to eliminate that irritating hum that other name brand bulbs have. The G3's are a plug and play LED bulb. Meaning they will fit perfectly into factory light sockets with no splicing, cutting, or soldering needed. All the G3 bulbs are outfitted with factory bulb connections making installation and quick and easy as possible. Engineered with PIAA's strict Japanese tolerance and manufacturing processes, the G3 LED bulbs with last longer than you probably will own the vehicle. PIAA are so confident that these are the finest made LED bulbs, they offer a 5-year warranty for peace of mind.  Note: Does not comply with FMVSS108 or CMVSS108.]]></sales_desc>

The technologically advanced design cancels unwanted steering forces in both directions, taking the place of two conventional opposing stabilizers. It will also respond to your input with 24 clicks of external adjustment to fine tune the feel.The integrated reservoir allows for additional fluid capacity and improves cooling during extreme use. Also included is FOX's relocating hardware that moves the steering stabilizer up and out of the way utilizing a new track bar relocation bolt and 1-3/8 tie-rod mounting clamp. An optional 1-5/8" mounting clamp is available for larger aftermarket tie-rods. The ATS represents a revolutionary breakthrough in stabilizer design.The 2.0 Performance Series IFP steering stabilizer helps take the load off your steering components and keep your tires tracking straight and true.

The large knobs and open tread pattern can cause your front end to wander on or off the road.The 2.0 Performance Series IFP stabilizer uses the same advanced damping technology contained in our Performance Series shocks to tame steering feedback from even the most aggressive tires."]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[This B&M shifter stick assembly is designed specifically for all 2007-Current Jeep Wrangler JK models with 6 speed manual transmissions and can be used as either a direct-replacement of the factory shifter stick, or as the finishing touch when used with B&M's JK Precision SportShifter part #45195. This stick is constructed from high strength 4340 nickel-chromoly steel and features improved bends that provide more shifting leverage and comfort than the factory stick. The stock Jeep shift handle has a thick and soft rubber isolator between the shifter and the stick that reduces transmission noise inside of the Jeep, but degrades over time and results in a very mushy feel. B&M's precision stick features a billet aluminum block with four replaceable rubber o-rings that provide isolation from transmission gear noise and also result in shorter, noticeably firmer and more positive shifts. The shift handle is finished off with a durable black e-coat and topped with a black round B&M logo engraved shift knob showing that you take off-road performance seriously. The stick features a 3/8 x 16 thread pattern so you can also customize the look of your shifter with other styles and colors of shift knobs."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Baja XRS Suspension Seat is one of the most anticipated seats ever to be offered to the Jeep, Truck, and Off-Road community. You probably saw our advertising campaign asking enthusiasts to help us come up with the ultimate reclining suspension seat. When you combine our years of expertise in aftermarket seating with thousands of designs from enthusiast across the country, you come up with what is hands down the best reclining suspension seat on the market. Most reclining suspension seats look the same, with the XRS we have added a little style and practicality. The Baja XRS combines injection molded memory foam with our suspension technology. Most suspension seats use a low quality cut foam, which over a short period of time will soften and wear to the point that your back and legs will pay the price. The Baja XRS on the other hand uses injection molded memory foam, which combined with our suspension technology, will provide unmatched comfort and support for years to come. The Baja XRS Suspension Seat is a direct bolt-in to CJ and YJ Jeeps and will fit in any other vehicle with Corbeau custom brackets. The Baja XRS will fit up to a 42 inch waist, while still comfortably fitting smaller drivers. The Baja XRS is available in all black vinyl or a black vinyl/cloth combo. Due to seat width the seat cannot recline all the way back when installed in Jeep. The seat will hit the roll bar if reclined all the way back.]]></sales_desc>

With the introduction of the revolutionary universal high output led light, the Solstice Solo s1100 pod, it was only natural that a portable reusable power source was created to allow the s1100 to be used anywhere for anything; and so Vision X battery packs were introduced in 2009 starting with the XPC-B22. The XPC-B22 is capable of powering a single Solstice Solo pod for over 3.5 hours, or two Solstice Solo pods for over 1.75 hours. Built to last the XPC-B22 comes in a ergonomically designed rubberized polycarbonate body, in a handle like form-factor. The rugged rubber case can be removed to allow for a smaller foot print.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The SDB-210HB uses a precision design Free Curve reflector that is outstandingly smooth and heat resistant. It reflects light efficiently due to the vaporized aluminum applied to the reflector surface. Aggressive off-road drivers will appreciate a lamp with a spot beam able to illuminate approximately 270 meters ahead, with a concentrated lighting pattern and a driving beam wide enough to supplement vehicle headlights by illuminating the entire surface in front of the vehicle. Hard off-road driving generates vibration and shock. The SDB-210HB has an internal light frame to protect the lamp and a stone guard to protect the lens. The body is constructed of a polycarbonate resin which has excellent impact resistance. Serious off-roaders usually run in serious weather. The SDB-210HB has weather resistant rubber seal to help protect the lamp integrity. The hardened glass lens gives excellent heat and thermal shock resistance, strength and translucency. The lamp illumination angle can be adjusted to 15 degrees up or down to fine-tune the light pattern. Dual beam control switch includes relay control feature and LED illumination when lamps are in use.]]></sales_desc>
