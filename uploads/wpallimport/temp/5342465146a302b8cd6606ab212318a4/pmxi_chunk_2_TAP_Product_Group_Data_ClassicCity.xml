		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The UTV series of the Sand Blaster tire from Sand Tires Unlimited was designed as a down scale Razor Back tire. Razor Back tires offer increased steering response over desert tires while offering improved flotation for the sand. Razor Backs feature multiple offset ridges on a smooth style tire which offers increased side bite for improved steering without digging too much into the sand or increasing rolling resistance. This improves the UTV Foots steering response and reduces understeer. For front sand tires, you are going to need to know if the tire will rub your car when you turn all the way left or all the way right. If you do not have tires yet, turn your steering wheel all the way to one side. Measure from the center of the spindle towards your chassis and double that dimension. For example, if from your spindle to your chassis you have 15 Inch then a 30 Inch diameter tire is going to rub the side of your vehicle and you will need something smaller in diameter or you are going to have to limit your turning radius.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The G2 Core DRS is a state-of-the-art off-road sway bar system for your Jeep Wrangler JK. Crawling on the ground to disconnect your sway bar links, forgetting to disconnect entirely or running without a sway bar can be a thing of the past. The DRS features two heat-treated chromoly shafts that work in unison via a hardened 4140 steel locking assembly. When engaged, the first and second stage torsion bars work together to provide rigid on-road stability that gives up to 20% more articulation than the stock sway bar. A switch inside the cabin of the Jeep controls a pneumatically actuated mechanism that disengages the primary 1-1/2-inch diameter first stage torsion bar, freeing up the suspension to move substantially more. The second stage 5/8-inch torsion bar remains engages and has a lighter spring rate to give minimal anti-roll leverage. The system is designed to work with existing on-board air compressor systems, can be disengaged and reengaged on the fly, and defaults to the engaged position as a safety precaution. The G2 Core DRS body is fully sealed for maintenance free use and is built from 6061 aluminum for superior corrosion resistance. The arms are built from 4140 chromoly steel and feature multiple attachment points to further fine tune the handling of your vehicle. The system can also accommodate manual sway bar disconnect links to completely disconnect the sway bar from the front differential.]]></sales_desc>

You can further customize the system to your needs by choosing either 8" diameter "Baja" pads or a 12" diameter Dakar pads for each Jack.<br><br>Each Dakar Series Jacking Systems includes: 1 Control Manifold, 1 Hydraulic Line Kit, 2 Service Wrenches (2" & 2 3/4"), 2 Upper Chassis Mounts (standard or lightweight) and a Mounting Hardware Kit."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Rounding out 2020, we developed the new Camburg X-Joint. It's an eXtreme performance, all-weather, all conditions, high angle ball-joint for our Camburg BJ performance upper control arms. These are much higher quality, considerably stronger and have an improved boot design that allows for higher angle use, better greasing and increased longevity. With higher strength heat-treated materials and an improved design, we were able to vastly improve upon what was available on the market. These are fully sealed and perfect for extreme conditions, so dirt, sand, rain, mud and snow are no match for them. The dual lip seal design on the boot insures the outside elements don't make their way in and contaminate the grease and joint.<br><br>The grease zerk fitting allows you to grease them on the truck without having to remove the boot. Our Camburg X-Joint is designed specifically for our ball-joint upper arms for optimum fit and maximum wheel travel. They do not retro-fit into uniball arms and are not designed for the stock sheet metal arms.<br><br>These fit Camburg P/N 310078 upper control arms.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Our Camburg preload spring spacers are a cost effective and easy way to lift the front of your 17-20 Ford Raptor while still keeping the plush factory ride. We offer them in red, black, KINETIK gray and gold versions. Don't confuse these with standard cheap spacer" lifts. These preload the coil spring, they do not space the shock down allowing the suspension to droop out too far and lose compression travel by bottoming out the shock sooner.<br><br>We CNC machine these in-house from aerospace quality 6061-T6 aluminum, then have them bead blasted, anodized and laser etched. These install easily onto your factory OEM Fox coilovers and lift the front end either 1.5 or 2 depending on which kit you go with. We recommend the 1.5 version to level the front end when running 35 tires and the 2 lift version when running larger 37 tires. These are not designed to be used with aftermarket coil springs on the OEM stock shocks.<br><br>On the 19-20 models with the electronic FOX Live Valve suspension you will need slightly modify the plastic wire retainer so that it presses back into the lower spring seat slot. You can do this with a file and/or small disc sander to reduce the thickness of the tab.<br><br>Made in the USA<br><br>To install these you will need to remove the coilovers from the truck. We recommend using a heavy duty spring compressor so you're able to collapse the spring enough to install our spacers onto the shock body which is a precision fit. You don't have to completely disassemble the shocks and springs.""]]></sales_desc>

Venator represents a sharp departure from typical bumper design- a dominant form, carefully crafted in clay and then forged in steel. Muscular contours and chiseled facets combine with the Venators radical arches, creating a bumper that clearly complements the overall aesthetics of the JL / JT, rather than fighting them. It's like nothing you've seen yet, but we should warn you; the Venator contains some intense visual content- viewer discretion is advised.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[An unrestrained pet in a moving vehicle can be dangerous, not only to the pet but also to yourself in the event of an accident. The patented design of the WeatherTech Pet Safety Harness provides your pet with the maximum level of safety and comfort, and it uses your vehicle's existing seat belts to keep your pet safe and secure on the road!<br><br>Your vehicle's seat belt is one of its most important safety features, and the WeatherTech Pet Harness lets you buckle your pet just like you would yourself. The harness is easy to put on and, unlike a traditional leash and/or collar, keeps any pressure or stress generated from the movement of the vehicle off of your pet's neck and onto its chest. The pet harness features a short tether that has two openings. Just pass your vehicle's seat belt through one of these openings and click the buckles together. Use the opening closer to your pet if you want to limit the amount of movement your pet is allowed. The WeatherTech Pet Harness can also be used in the cargo area of your vehicle with a climbing grade locking carabiner.<br><br>In the event of an accident, a large unrestrained pet can exert upwards of 2,500 pounds of force to itself and the other occupants of the vehicle. The WeatherTech Pet Safety Harness's unique patented design and heavy duty construction make it one of the strongest and safest pet travel harnesses available. The webbing material exceeds S.A.E. standards for human seat belts, and it has been independently tested to human seat belt safety standards. The WeatherTech Pet Safety Harness can also be used even if your pet isn't in your vehicle. The same tether that keeps your pet safe during car rides can also be hooked to your pet's leash for walks around the neighborhood or hiking down trails. The harness keeps any pressure from your pet pulling against you on its chest, not its neck!<br><br><strong>Sizing</strong><br><br>To insure proper sizing you will need your dog's weight and rib cage circumference (to]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Sometimes people get ask, Why you would want a remote control for your train horn kit?  Why wouldn't you?! Have you ever been in a packed parking lot and had someone come a little too close for comfort to your ride? Maybe you have some kick-ass wheels they want a closer look at. Maybe they like your sweet paint job (or probably admiring your HornBlasters stickers). With this nifty little key fob, you can remind everyone in the parking lot (and probably a few parking lots over) that they can look, but not touch without bringing a spare pair of underwear. With a range of up to 100 yards, another bonus is you will never have a hard time finding your vehicle in the parking lot ever again. These horns sound even better from outside the vehicle than inside the cab, so again we ask, why would you ever not want a remote for your train horn kit?"]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Pure Performance Prodigy 2.625 Inch Triple Bypass Shocks fluted aluminum body gives the advantage of weight reduction without sacrificing strength. Which not only make this shock the lightest in its class, it also provides a surface area greater than most 3 inch bodied shocks. The fluting provides the structure required to ensure the aluminum cylinders are as strong, if not stronger than their steel 2.5 inch counterparts. The shock bodies are also treated with a military grade hard anodized coating so you never have to worry about corrosion.<br><br>A high quality DU bearing provides the bearing surface for the massive 1 inch polished 17-4 PH Stainless Steel shaft. And unlike chrome plated shafts these precipitation hardened stainless steel shafts are bare so you never have to worry about pitting or flaking potentially destroying the seals. While a military grade hard anodized billet aluminum valve circuit with digressive valving controls the dampening, redundant sealing technology that utilizes Viton O-rings and seals keep the shock oil where is belongs. The shock oil is formulated for fade-free dampening and smooth rebounds. Its high viscosity index and shear stability controls shock fade.<br><br>This with a custom moly piston wear band greatly reduces shock body wear. The 3 bypass tubes are machined for one compression adjuster, one rebound adjuster, and one free bleed adjuster. Custom applications are available. All these features combine to make the Pure Performance Prodigy 2.625 Inch Triple Bypass Shock a fraction of the weight of the competitions 2.5 inch steel body counterparts and cool twice as fast for fade resistant performance. And all Pure Performance Prodigy Shocks come with a 6 month Warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Even a slight lift beyond stock will result in more lateral motion in the axle, resulting in problematic handling, steering feel, sway and potentially wobble at higher speeds. <br><br>If you have a spring over axle setup on your Samurai and you're not yet convinced that a Panhard bar would benefit you, try this: Take a buddy with you and park your Samurai against a curb. Get out while your buddy takes the drivers' seat. While your buddy turns the steering left and right so that the tire is pressing against the curb, watch how much play there is between the body and the axle. If the lateral movement you see in't the result of worn bearings or bushings, a Panhard Bar would essentially eliminate that movement and deliver significant improvements in handling.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[TeraFlex partnered with FOX Racing Shox to create a lightweight Aircraft-grade 6061-T6 heat treated aluminum shock body, long travel performance shock with TeraFlex specific valving to handle the extreme demands that a PreRunner requires. Our testing with the FOX Racing Shox development team in the southern California desert resulted in one the most performance oriented race-ready shocks available today. It features an impact cold forged body construction, hard anodized aluminum body for corrosion resistance and superior heat dissipation. The pressure balanced shock delivers superior handling characteristics to maintain maximum tire contact during all points of suspension travel. Velocity sensitive valve plates, Aircraft grade shock oil and 200 psi nitrogen gas charge provide optimal performance and superior hot/cold temperature resistant properties. The external remote reservoir design separates shock oil from the high-pressure nitrogen, and the internal floating piston (IFP) reduces cavition to provide consistent performance under repeated high intensity shock cycling. TeraFlex spent hundreds of man hours with the FOX engineers on-site tuning and valving with extensive driver feedback to deliver this formidable shock that handles the toughest and fastest trails out there. Because the TeraFlex FOX valving codes are proprietary, these exclusive PreRunner valved shocks are only available through TeraFlex and our Authorized Dealers. If you have a TeraFlex LCG PreRunner suspension system, and want maximum shock performance to match, don't substitute - get TeraFlex Tuned FOX Racing Shox.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[TeraFlex partnered with FOX Racing Shox to create a lightweight Aircraft-grade 6061-T6 heat treated aluminum shock body, long travel performance shock with TeraFlex specific valving to handle the extreme demands that a PreRunner requires. Our testing with the FOX Racing Shox development team in the southern California desert resulted in one the most performance oriented race-ready shocks available today. It features an impact cold forged body construction, hard anodized aluminum body for corrosion resistance and superior heat dissipation. The pressure balanced shock delivers superior handling characteristics to maintain maximum tire contact during all points of suspension travel. Velocity sensitive valve plates, Aircraft grade shock oil and 200 psi nitrogen gas charge provide optimal performance and superior hot/cold temperature resistant properties. The external remote reservoir design separates shock oil from the high-pressure nitrogen, and the internal floating piston (IFP) reduces cavition to provide consistent performance under repeated high intensity shock cycling. TeraFlex spent hundreds of man hours with the FOX engineers on-site tuning and valving with extensive driver feedback to deliver this formidable shock that handles the toughest and fastest trails out there. Because the TeraFlex FOX valving codes are proprietary, these exclusive PreRunner valved shocks are only available through TeraFlex and our Authorized Dealers. If you have a TeraFlex LCG PreRunner suspension system, and want maximum shock performance to match, don't substitute - get TeraFlex Tuned FOX Racing Shox.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Whether it was the thrill of climbing over ten-ton boulders or your slightly unhealthy obsession with mud, you bought a Jeep -- and not just any Jeep. You bought a Wrangler, and now you eat, sleep and breathe off-roading. ARIES Jeep fender flares add style and off-road readiness to your mud-eating machine, featuring a 4 inch width and custom contour bends. With lightweight aluminum construction and a textured powder coat finish, these fender flares are made to go off road.<br></br>Hardened, T6 aluminum construction allows ARIES fender flares to be strong, lightweight and rust-free. We also cover them in a durable, textured black powder coat finish to easily hide scratches, dirt and other threats on the trail. The 4 inch width and vehicle-specific contours of ARIES Jeep fender flares offer a precise fit, adding style, utility and accommodating the off-road ride. The flares bolt directly onto the body, replacing the factory flares, and they can accept LED side markers for maximum safety on and off the road (some drilling may be required).<br></br>To make your mudding machine safe on the trail and on the road, ARIES Jeep fender flare side markers offer bright, DOT-approved LED light. When installing ARIES Jeep fender flares, the OEM side markers on your Jeep must be removed. However, you don't have to play the outlaw just to add some flare to your ride. ARIES Jeep side markers splice directly into the existing factory wiring harness of the OEM side marker and are able to be channeled through the frame of the fender flares to keep the wires well-protected from moisture, grime and road debris.<br></br>You didn't buy that Jeep just to park it in the garage, and you certainly didn't buy those off-road tires to keep them hidden. Give your off-roader the recognition it deserves with ARIES Jeep fender flares.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Poison Spyder Bombshell diff covers are designed with the singular goal of protecting your Jeeps  gears, lockers and diff cover bolts from the most punishing rocks and trail hazards. The stock covers your vehicle came with are weak, stamped sheetmetal. Even a moderate tap with a rock can cave it in against your ring gear, causing potential damage to the gears, locker and carrier bearings, not to mention a difficult, messy trail fix.Even more common, though less catastrophic, is peel back that can occur when sliding over a rock causes the lip of the cover to peel up, allowing your gear oil to drain causing a hazard for both your Jeep and the environment. The Bombshell Diff Cover is your best insurance against each of these hazards. The Bombshell differential cover is cast from highly ductile nodular ironthe same material drag racing differential housings are cast from to handle thousands of horsepower. The design of the Bombshell incorporates recesses to protect the diff cover bolt heads from trail damage, while the profile of the Bombshell acts as a ramp to help slide your Jeep up and over the most troublesome pumpkin-eaters.The ramp profile also results in an extremely thick & up to 1 inch thickcross-section around the bolt ring, where contact with the rocks is most likely. Throughout the rest of its cross-section the Bombshell is the thickest cast differential cover on the market, from 7/16 inch to a brutal 1/2 inch thick at the outermost surface.]]></sales_desc>

The BFH bumper is CNC laser-cut from a single piece of high strength 3/16 inch plate steel, then precision brake-formed for an exact fit. The BFH bumper features an integrated winch mount and one-piece design.<br><br>All BFH Bumpers are fabricated from 100% cold, hard steel. Some manufacturers have begun producing aluminum bumpers in order to "save weight", but at a mere 35 pounds, the BFH is among the lightest bumpers on the market, and you sacrifice none of the strength or durability you would with an aluminum bumper. Even fully outfitted with Brawler Bar and Heavy Duty Shackle Tabs, the BFH weighs only 43 pounds!<br><br>The Brawler Bar is a lower-profile Stinger, fashioned after the 2-bend Stinger featured on our Original RockBrawler bumper for JK. The Brawler Bar features the most versatile combination of trail protection and a lower profile for easier access to the engine compartment, fitment into garages and trailers, etc. Plus it looks bad-ass! The Brawler Bar extends 7.4 inch forward from the front edge of the bumper, and 9.8" high from the top surface of the bumper.<br><br>The Trail Stinger is similar in proportion to the famous Poison Spyder Trail Stinger. This time-honored design has proven itself on hundreds of Jeeps over the past decade, providing simple, clean lines along with a measure of forward-flop protection. The Trail Stinger extends 13.4 inch forward from the front edge of the bumper, and 17 inch high from the top surface of the bumper.<br><br>The Comp Stinger for the BFH front bumper matches the lines of our stand-alone Comp Stingers.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Poison Spyder JK Body Armor is recommended equipment for any JK venturing into off road situations where body damage is eminent. JK Body Armor protects the thin factory sheetmetal with rugged, precision-fit 3/16 inch plate steel or aluminum. Used by itself, JK Body Armor hugs the Jeep's body contours to provide protection with no loss of ground clearance. Used with the factory Rubicon rocker rails, the JK Body Armor helps prevent trail damage that can be caused by rocks pushing the factory rocker rails up into the body. And used with Poison Spyder's JK Rocker Knockers, the JK Body Armor provides one more line of defense for your JK, in the most complete, strongest, best looking package of rocker panel protection gear available for the JK.JK Body Armor is manufactured from either 3/16 inch high pressure steel plate or 3/16 inch 6061-T6 aluminum plate. Steel is preferred where the JK Body Armor will be installed by itself, without Rocker Knockers or other rocker panel protection. Aluminum is recommended where Rocker Knockers, the stock Rubicon rocker rails or other rocker panel protection will also be used. The aluminum pieces are much lighter weight (27 lbs. lighter for the 4-door versions), yet still provide excellent load distribution characteristics when used as a secondary barrier in conjunction with external rocker rails. Both steel and aluminum versions may be painted or powdercoated prior to installation, but only the aluminum ones may be installed raw without any protective coating. They may also be polished or clear-coated at the installer's discretion. Both steel and aluminum parts are CNC-laser cut and precision brake-formed for a precise fit to the unique contours of the JK body. Bolt holes are countersunk, and stainless steel flat head cap screws are supplied for a clean, flush-surface installation. Drilling of the body is required for installation.]]></sales_desc>

This strap was designed for use with the Poison Spyder Rear Stinger Tire Carrier, but can be used with other DIY-fabricated spare tire mounts or to simply tie the spare tire down into the bed of the vehicle. The use of a strap allows virtually infinite adjustability for any size tire, while allowing quick, easy access to the spare tire without having to use any extra tools. All of these reasons are why similar straps are routinely used for spare tire hold-down duty in off-road racing. Heavy duty ratchet lets you easily adjust, tighten and release tension.

We do not offer a powder coat option for this item.IMPORTANT: The BFH Disco Skid was designed to work with the 07-11 JK Rubicon sway bar disconnect mechanism. It is NOT designed to work with the 2012 and newer units. Customers may use this product on their 2012 and newer JK Rubicon at their own discretion, but Poison Spyder makes no warranty as to fitment or guarantee against damage to other components of the Jeep due to the use of this product on 2012 and newer JK Rubicons.NOTE: The JK BFH Disco Skid works only in conjunction with the JK BFH Front Bumper.

		<long_desc><![CDATA[The AirDog Fuel Preporator, with the capability to provide fuel at flows and pressures beyond the maximum requirements of the engine, receives fuel under vacuum from the fuel tank containing entrained air/vapor, particulate contaminates and unknown quantities of moisture. The fuel passes through the water separator which removes the water and large particulate contaminates that could damage or jam the gearator fuel pump. The fuel, with only entrained air/vapor and tiny particulate contaminates remaining, enters the fuel pump. The fuel, now under positive pressure flow, enters the filter. As the fuel passes through the filter media and the remaining particulate contaminates are caught and contained, the entrained air/vapor is also separated. Through the positive fuel air separation features of the patented Fuel Preporator the separated air/vapor is discharged from the filter through the Primary Air/Vapor Discharge Port and into the return to tank passage after the regulator. The fuel passing through the filter media (free of contaminates & power robbing air/vapor and at pressures and flows to meet the needs of the engine exits the fuel filter through two passageways. The fuel for the engine, passes into the fuel pickup tube and out to the engine). The excess fuel not needed by the engine is released through the pressure regulator to combine with the air/vapor and foam as it returns to the fuel tank.
