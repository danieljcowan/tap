		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The all-new Trail Grappler M/T blends some of the off-road performance of the Mud Grappler with the on-road comfort of the Terra Grappler to create a tire that is both aggressive and quiet. For off-road performance, the sidewall combines a 3-ply high turn-up construction with a thick rubber compound that cushions the tire and helps prevent punctures. On the tread surface, the blocks are configured to provide additional biting edges that command lateral stability and enhance forward traction. For on-road comfort, Nitto?s engineers used advanced sound analysis equipment to reduce the noise levels commonly associated with off-road tires. The internal construction and tread design also help optimize tread life. Two wide steel belts provide a stable base for the tire and increase tread strength. This advanced construction provides optimal uniformity and reduces irregular wear.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Terra Grappler G2 is Nittos next generation all-terrain light truck tire specifically designed to meet your everyday on and off-road adventures. Whether you are commuting to work, towing a trailer or headed up to your favorite mountain trail; the balanced off-road and on-road performance of the Terra Grappler G2 will get you to your destination. Through the introduction of new materials, Nitto was able to maintain the versatile all-terrain compound while increasing the longevity of the treadwear. For the first time Nitto is backing an all-terrain product with a limited treadwear warranty which covers 50,000 miles for LT-metric and floatation sizes, and 65,000 miles for hard metric sizes. Nitto decided to reinforce the coupling joints in the Terra Grappler G2, which connects the outer most tread blocks to the center blocks, to increase the block edge rigidity. Terra Grappler G2 is equipped with full depth siping. Not only do the full depth sipes offer a functional benefit, it helps maintain the appearance of the tread design as the tire wears. The staggered shoulder lugs on the Terra Grappler G2 provides additional biting edges in off-road conditions. The computer analyzed tread block arrangement reduces tire noise normally heard at highway driving speeds. The Terra Grappler G2 features two distinct and bold sidewall designs. One side features homage to the original Terra Grappler design by incorporating a similar thunderbolt pattern which has been raised to give it a more aggressive look than its predecessor. The other side features a brand new aggressive blade design which features integrated sidewall lugs that run all the way from the shoulder tread block down to the sidewall.]]></sales_desc>

ODYSSEY batteries have been designed to keep up with the changes. Because their plates are made of pure virgin lead (unlike the lead alloy in most batteries), we can pack in more plates. And more plates mean more plate surface area, and much more power ? twice the overall power and three times the life of conventional batteries ? up to 400 cycles at 80% depth of discharge!]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Monster-Ram improves airflow from the intercooler. Raises boost without increasing backpressure at the turbine. Result: a more responsive, fuel-efficient engine. Up to six 1/8 inch NPT ports for flexibility! At Banks Power, just enough is never enough when it comes to engine airflow. Maximum power, performance and efficiency are the ultimate goals, but to make it all happen the engine has to breathe freely and without needless restrictions. Finding ways to pump your engine full of cooler, denser air has always been the key. Our High-Ram intakes have always whipped the competition. Our new Monster-Ram flat-out destroys it. Utilizing the latest in electronic computational fluid-dynamic technology, tested on the flow bench as well as on the dyno, and finally proven in the real world where the rubber meets the road, Monster-Ram is a beast that only Banks could have unleashed. A simple, direct-replacement casting, Monster-Ram is instant power, performance and acceleration gratification. The factory inlet is cramped and angular compared to Banks' larger, streamlined cast-metal Monster-Ram. It's the perfect upgrade whether you're just starting out or working to build a serious, purpose-built machine. And with up to six ports for water/meth/propane/nitrous injection (or pressure/temp. sensors), the sky's the limit for performance expandability. Monster-Ram is CNC port-matched to the stock heater as well as the optional Banks Billet Intake Grid Heater Delete spacer. Includes 3-1/2 inch mandrel-bent boost tube. With up to six ports for water/meth/propane/nitrous injection (or pressure/temp. sensors), the sky's the limit for Monster-Ram's performance expandability.]]></sales_desc>

The overall design gives today's on-and-off-road driver a tire that is both directionally and laterally stable; unmatched in performance. This is an extremely aggressive design that requires strict attention to air pressure when run on the highway. **TREAD DESIGN MAY DIFFER BY SIZE**<br><br>Any off-roader knows that tires can make a huge difference between safely driving on a trail and not. For mud boggers, they're even more important. Without features like superior traction and tread cleaning, it's easy to get stuck while the competition powers ahead to the finish line. But there is a tire that has both those advantages and more: the legendary Super Swamper TSL. Sure, you could buy this tire probably anywhere, but 4 Wheel Parts offers the best value for your money. With everyday low prices, fast shipping and world-class service, we're your best destination for Super Swamper mud tires.<br><br> <b>Your Destination for Super Swamper Tires</b><br> You may notice that we called Super Swamper truck tires legendary. They're one of the top picks among professional mud boggers for many reasons. Diligent engineering and design results in a unique tire tread pattern with short, intermediate and long massive lugs. Super Swamper TSL tires bite soft ground quickly, but their tread also self-cleans to maintain consistent traction on even the sloppiest mud.<br><br> Now that you know how excellent Super Swampers are, it's time to put them on your vehicle.

It is in bias ply construction which allows for the more aggressive lugs and very strong sidewalls to better resist the rigors of hard off-roading.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Our shock mounted lights began with the famous KC Daylighter that we invented and patented in 1972. Not only does the Daylighter use a heavy-duty rubber gasket (bulb holder) that isolates the lens, reflector, and bulb from the metal housing and elements of weather, but it also includes our patented shock mounting system. The KC HiLiTES shock mounting system was developed as a way to isolate the lamp unit from the mounting bracket or surface to which the light is mounted. This system successfully reduces lamp failure due to vibration and has been proven through the extremes of off road racing. Now, the shock mount system has been updated from the original to require no extra drilling.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[At Factor 55 we have been using a version of our custom ultra short flat straps for years to assist in a variety of useful vehicle recovery applications. These short straps are not constructed like typical recovery/snatch straps. The Shorty Straps are not designed to store energy from stretch. They are designed to serve as a versatile short soft link to attach to vehicles and are constructed of an ultra low stretch (low energy storage) polyester, not high stretch nylon like typical snatch straps. The applications vary from easily attaching to vehicles that are not equipped with recovery points, to using your winch and Shorty Strap to field repair/straighten bent steering components like tie rods and drag links. The inherit flat shape of the straps prevent the straps from rolling and twisting when attached to tubular shapes like bumper stingers, steering components, and nerf bars. We prefer flat straps over round ropes for this reason. Even polyester webbing materials retain a small element of material stretch and since the total energy stored is a function of the % of stretch and the overall length of the strap, we have designed the strap to be as short as possible but still retain the necessary webbing overlap and stitch count necessary for the rated loads. The overall length of the Shorty Straps is 3 feet, and this is reduced to only 1.5 feet long when used in the common basket configuration. Low stretch/energy storage equates to less recoil energy during a possible component failure. The strap is manufactured in the USA to Factor 55 specifications by the Certified Sling Corporation, the parent company to the well known Bubba Rope Company.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[When Jeep introduced the 4-door Wrangler Unlimited in 2007, it revolutionized wheeling with an open top vehicle that provided enough space for the whole family and all their gear. You still need to do something with that gear when you arrive at camp though. The Smittybilt Tailgate Table is made out of 1/8-inch thick steel and can hold up to 30 pounds to keep your meal out of the dirt. Smittybilt thought of everything, with integrated cup holders that ensure that spilled beverages are a thing of the past. Have a 2-door JK? Don't fret, the Smittybilt Tailgate Table fits both two door and four door JK Wranglers and fit with the factory subwoofer. The Tailgate Table is only 1-1/2-inches thick when closed, minimizing the space taken up during storage. In addition to being a great place to grill food or eat your lunch, the Tailgate Table makes an excellent work bench for trail repairs. Heavy duty spring loaded pull pins lock the table in position, and it can be mounted inside or outside with the table top up or down to match the Jeep owner's preference.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[T&T Customs, Inc. Adventure Steps feature rugged construction and sleek styling giving our steps a one-two punch. Our Adventure Steps are constructed of 3/16 plate steel and 2" X 2" X .188" square tubing. Sliders mount to the three center body mounts using rugged mounting brackets that distribute the potential loads evenly across the frame. Our steps not only provide added protection but with their additional width and double row dimpled panel they make accessing rooftop cargo even easier. The Jeep JKs rocker panel has very little structure behind it so our Adventure Steps mount to the frame only. For superior strength during offroad use the boatside panels which mount to both the frame and to the underside of our slider adding considerable rigidity and strength as well as protecting your vulnerable body mounts. Boatside panels run the full length of the slider and are available in 3/16" 6061 aluminum for those wanting to keep added weight to a minimum. Boatside panels ship bare."]]></sales_desc>
