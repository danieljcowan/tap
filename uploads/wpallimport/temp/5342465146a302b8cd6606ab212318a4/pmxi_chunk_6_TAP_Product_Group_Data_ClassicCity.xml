		<sales_desc><![CDATA[STI Tire & Wheel is thrilled to announce the release of the all-new Silverback-XLite ATV Tire. Mud enthusiasts around the country spoke, and STI listened. This new tire is based on one of the most successful STI mud tires of all times, the Gorilla Silverback, but the XLite is more accessible and useful to riders. The Silverback-XLite takes most of the features of the original Silverback and puts them in a lighter and more value-oriented package. It still delivers maximum traction in deep mud from its distinctive, aggressive, widely spaced tread pattern, but with less bulk. The lugs range from 1.125 to 1.250 inches tall depending on tire size. This allows for smoother, more versatile performance when not slinging mud in your favorite bog. It?s easier on the machine, and when comparing costs, it?s also much easier on the budget.]]></sales_desc>

As with all high stall converters they will generate more heat than a stock converter and this condition is worsened due to the decreased fluid capacity in the system. Installing a deeper oil pan on the transmission will bring the fluid quantity back up to the stock capacity or higher.]]></sales_desc>

From producing white light that is the closest possible imitation of sunlight, to a virtually indestructible polycarbonate lens, these lights are the premium choice.<br><br>Unlike high-intensity discharge (HID) lights, the LED range does not require time to warm up and performs brilliantly on corrugated roads by producing a broad field of light that helps diffuse vibration.<br><br>Submersible to 10ft, compliant for radio interference suppression, the ARB Intensity LED lights have been vibration tested to military specifications to ensure they can withstand extended periods of heavy corrugations and extreme conditions to keep the road ahead brightly lit.<br><br>The Intensity V2 uses the same optimal chassis design as the previous generation, incorporating the latest in LED technologyOSRAM GIANTS. The Intensity spot-light configuration uses advanced optics via the latest HyperspotTM technology. The Intensity flood-light configuration has been updated to spread the light further down the road. Pairing the spot and flood combination will give long-range visibility and shoulder-to-shoulder visibility.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Draw Tapered & Diamond Cut Leaves: Ensure the load is progressively distributed over a larger surface area, reducing the high stresses that develop at leaf ends. This provides increased ride quality and protection against leaf breakage, significantly increasing the spring life. Fully Scragged & Load Tested: Scragging ensures the spring takes a permanent 'set' which reduces the risk of sagging. Load testing ensures the spring meets the required specification. Graphite Coating: To further reduce the friction between the spring leaves & friction pads. Military Wrap: Designed to provide added safety. Anti Friction Pads: Regreasable nylon interleaf liners reduce friction at the leaf tips where the load is the greatest. Flat Axle Seat Area: Allows a positive, safe axle mount reducing spring stress & increasing spring life. Shot Peening: The tension side of all leaves is shot peened to reduce spring stress. This process can double the life of a spring. Two-stage Leaf Pack: Featured on most rear springs for optimum comfort. When unladen the vehicle is largely riding on the primary stage, with the secondary stage providing additional support when a heavy load is added.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The new Kakadu model tent is a new addition to the successful range of ARB Touring products. It shares many features and components with the Simpson model but has been designed for simpler set up and warmer climates where maximum ventilation is required. While it shares many of the frame components with the Simpson III, the Kakadu does not include the extendable veranda section. This makes the Kakadu ideal for fitment to the rear of utility/pick-up vehicles and trailers where the floor level can be mounted lower to the ground with no access issues to the tent. For increased ventilation, the Kakadu features larger side window openings without the canvas awning over the window exterior. This allows for greater air flow through the tent but also increased view and natural light. Internal canvas shutters are still fitted to seal the windows during inclement weather. To provide rain cover to the windows, the fly sheet has been extended and provides more protection to the entire tent. Also new to the Kakadu is a lighter high density, single layer extruded foam mattress. This reduces the overall weight of the tent and allows for easier folding of the tent during pack up.]]></sales_desc>

The rack comes complete with our Universal Light Mount system that allows for cube lights, single row and dual row light bars to mount in multiple locations on all four sides of the roof rack. The bottom of the ADD MaxRax roof rack incorporates slats that are adjustable to your desired width to fit bags, coolers, etc. For Jeep JK there are two mounting options to choose from: Roll cage mount for when the top is off, and hard top mount for when the hard top is on; there is no soft top mount available at this time.The all-aluminum system built from 5052-0 and receives hammer black six-stage powder coat before it is shipped. Assembly is required, and is easily bolted together. Patent pending.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Spartacus HD Tire Carrier System provides the ultimate in strength and stability for mounting your oversized wheel and tire. Functionally designed to manage the amplified force and vibrations produced during extreme off-road conditions. The precision die-cast aluminum Hinge Casting provides maximum strength without the excess weight of steel. The one-piece design maintains one-handed access to cargo area and rigidly links the Wheel Mount to the reinforced section of the rear quarter panel. This, in combination with forged steel hinge brackets and hardened steel pins, results in far superior load capacity than the factory tailgate hinges, thereby effectively reducing wear and increasing longevity. The Wheel Mount lifts the mounting position and incorporates depth and tilt adjustability for large diameter and wide tire options. Tested to MIL-STD-810 to simulate extended duration of vigorous off-road driving conditions. Rated for up to and including 37 inch wheel tire combinations. Includes adjustable third brake light bracket. Compatible with OE and most aftermarket rear bumpers. No drilling required.]]></sales_desc>

The IPT provides an incredible 200 spread of usable light.<br><br>The housing was designed to provide exceptional heat dispersion by using Direct Ducted Cooling, which allows air to travel from the front of the housing to the rear. With a day-time running light (Pro and Racer Editions only), low, and high power mode, the LP9 will fulfill all your lighting needs.<br><br>Available in a Sport model for most every-day enthusiasts, a Pro model for those that need the extra forward projecting lumens and intensity, and a Racer Edition configuration that is designed for the demands of high speed driving. The Racer Edition has similar power draw, but produces a much tighter pattern, providing higher visibility at greater distances. All models feature uService technology, which allows customers to change the lens pattern and color depending on driving conditions, or simply when they want to refresh the lens."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Michelin Latitude Tour HP is a high performance tire for premium Crossover vehicles that offers safe, reliable Handling and a quiet, comfortable ride. The Latitude Tour HP is better handling in rain and snow than leading competitors tires. This is based on third-party snow traction and wet braking test results versus Bridgestone Dueler H/L Alenza tires, Continental 4x4 Contact tires, and Pirelli Scorpion STR tires. 2-D Active Sipes help deliver better handling in rain and snow by locking together for greater rigidity. High-Speed Confidence (Exceeding the safe legal speed limit is neither recommended nor endorsed). Experience a stable feel and crisp steering at high speeds thanks to precisely placed polyester and aramid/nylon filaments (FAZ Technology) under the tread. Aramid is the material that makes bulletproof vests bulletproof. The Latitude Tour HP is a fuel efficient tire that helps reduce harmful emissions. Save money at the pump thanks to a combination of a fuel efficient tire shape and tread compounds which reduces unnecessary friction when the tire rolls.]]></sales_desc>
