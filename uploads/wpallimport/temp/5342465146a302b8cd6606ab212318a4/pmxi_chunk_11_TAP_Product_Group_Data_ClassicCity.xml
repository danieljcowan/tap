		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Save both space and money when you decide you want a spring under your antenna. Instead of buying a stud mount and a spring as individual components, you can buy one part and have it all. The springs are made of stainless steel for many years of service. Two basic models (ring terminal connections and screw-on connection), each available in a medium duty model and in a heavy duty model, are available. Each spring stands about 3 inches (77mm) above the mount surface. The medium duty models are great for 2 ft Firestik & Firestik II antennas as well as 3ft FireFly and Road Pal antennas. The heavy duty models may be used with any antenna up to 5 ft in length.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[If you took the proven features and performance of the famous KW" series antennas and added a unique tuning mechanism to the top, you would own the equivalent of a Firestik II, "FS" Series antenna. Aside from the ease of tuning, the patented design broadens the antennas bandwidth to keep SWR lower over more channels. The upper coil extension also increases the power handling capability of the antenna. All "FS" antennas are compatible with autos, trucks, vans, motorcycles and ATV's in a single antenna configuration when metallic ground plane is available. Or, they may be used in dual (co-phased) configuration on any vehicle made from any type of material. Like all CB antennas, the "FS" antennas should be fine-tuned (SWR) in their final mounting location. If you have ever tuned a non-tunable tip antenna, you will have a real appreciation for the "FS" antennas. To tune a "FS" antenna, you just pop-of the tip and turn the adjustment screw up or down as needed. All "FS" antennas exceed the requirements of any CB radio, new or old. Aside from the hi-performance loading coil that maximizes the transmit/receive functions of your CB, these top-loaded antennas will also receive the NOAA emergency weather alert and national weather broadcasts for radios with those features. The "FS" antennas are 100% American made with 100% American materials. To maintain a balance between flexibility and ruggedness, we use a custom blended, glass fiber reinforced shaft. Each is wound with heavy insulated copper wire to prevent the oxidation and shorted windings often found on non-Firestik antennas. The tunable tip mechanism is made from rust-proof brass and has a rubber o-ring to hold the adjuster in place after tuning. Our 3/8"-24 threaded base has a tapered contact point that works especially well with Firestik mounts and accessories. The tapered "lug-nut" effect transfers stress away from the threads and reduces the possibility of vibration induced loosening of the antenna in its mount. E"]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The K&N Electronic Carburetor Injection, or ECI, is a bolt-on system that adds a supplemental fuel source to your engine. The system consists of a carb spacer plate with a fuel block and injector, an ECU, and a wide band O2 sensor. The plate has a provision for the fuel injector. When needed, the injector squirts atomized fuel into the air stream passing through the spacer plate.In a way, the ECI system works like an EFI system that reads the air/fuel ratio fed to it from an included O2 sensor that you install in your exhaust. Where this differs from EFI, is that it is used in conjunction with the carburetor. Any time the system detects a lean condition, the injector will kick on to bring the AFR back to spec, but the engine is still fed primarily by the carb. The ECI acts as a supplement to your existing carburated setup, rather than a complete replacement system such as EFI or TBI.The brain of the ECI system is the ECU, which vigilantly monitors the input from the oxygen sensor to ensure an optimal air-to-fuel ratio is maintained. If the system detects an AFR higher than the user-defined limit, the injector will fire. Unlike a typical electronic fuel injection system, the ECI works cooperatively with your existing carburetor, supporting the fuel flow rates that high-horsepower vehicles require to operate efficiently. If your engine is performing lean, K&N's ECI system will help make up for the fuel deficit.While users can opt to set only basic parameters if they choose, other more specific parameterslike injector pulse width, shot volume, progressive injector firing, and minimum/maximum RPM rangeare all alterable, making the system extremely versatile.  K&N Electronic Carburetor Injection (ECI) BrainK&N Electronic Carburetor Injection (ECI) Installed K&N's Electronic Carburetor Injection is very easy to install and can be done in a matter of hours, not days like some EFI kits. The three major components are the spacer plate with injector, the ECU with]]></sales_desc>

Once the TG Battery Box has been mounted you simply remove the three bolts and the top lifts off and allows you to remove or install the battery in minutes. The TG Battery Box can either be mounted where your OEM battery was, or, due to its  inchflat back inch design, it can be mounted behind your seat or cab. Also present on the TG battery box are 9 mounting holes in the bottom for ease of installation. The TG Battery Box works with Diehard Platinum and Odyssey DT 34/78 size batteries.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[MADE IN THE USA<br></br>Our fenders blend the aggressive, true flatty fender look of the original Jeep to the more modern Wrangler. Our fenders also provide more clearance for a taller tire and more aggressive looks. The MCE-spec TPO plastic will not sag or crack and isUV-stable. A common problem with rigid metal fenders is transferring energy to the Jeep's body, and denting the panel the flare is attached to. MCE flares are flexible enough to absorb an impact on the trail and save your Jeep's body.<br></br> Gen II fenders are black in color with an OE-like surface texture, while the Gen III flares are glossy smooth with a realistic carbon fiber look (Flexible Carbon Fiber").  MCE TJ and YJ front fenders are installed over a trimmed OE fender, so the inner fenders and the accessories mounted to them remain untouched. A paper cutting template and instructions are supplied with the fenders.<br></br> Our material is so strong, our fenders have a NO fine print LIFETIME warranty to the original buyer against cracking. Cold weather, off-road use, etc. does not affect this warranty."]]></sales_desc>

The BD AutoLoc commands the torque converter to lock up, and stay locked up, any time the exhaust brake is applied in third and fourth gears. This not only helps with engine braking, but because there?s no clutch slippage, transmission oil temperatures remain low. The lock-up clutch and exhaust brake automatically disengage at low speeds to prevent stalling and transmission/converter damage.]]></sales_desc>

The bumper incorporates factory fog light cutouts and mounts, as well as integrated tabs to mount aftermarket fog/driving lamps, fully welded shackle mounts, an integrated recessed winch plate, and the option to install our Air Dam Skid Plate and/or our Tube Winch Guard. <br> <br>Another great feature, which is not common with all bumpers, is that you can mount your winch after the bumper is installed on the Jeep. If you will not be running a winch right away our bumper kit includes a winch delete plate. The plate is flat and fills the void of where the winch would be and can be easily bolted on and off.<br><br>This heavy-duty bumper is fabricated using USA Grade 3/16 inch Steel Plate, laser cut, CNC formed, robotically welded, and hand finished by craftsmen.  The D-Ring mounts are 5/8 inch Thick Plate and welded solid front and back so they can be used as recovery points.<br><br>All JK Front Bumpers receive a thorough zinc phosphate rinse and cleaning, then are E-Coated and Powder Coated with a lightly textured black finish. Our unique textured finish is easy to clean and matches almost perfectly to the black factory fender flares. This bumper is completely Bolt on, No Drilling Required.<br><br>*On 2012+ model Wranglers, a vacuum canister relocation kit may be needed, depending on the size of your winch.<br>]]></sales_desc>

We also added rubber pads that go between the jack and the mounts and a Velcro strap to hold the handle in place so that no vibration will be heard from any of the mounting locations.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Coyote Enterprises Internal Boltless Beadlock is a tire within a tire. It divides the tires air chamber into two separate compartments and thus has two valve stems. One is for the tire and the other for the beadlock. Think of the beadlock Case as a mini-tire and hence its parts are named the same. There is a Tread, two Sidewalls and two Beads. A heavy duty inner tube within the beadlock Case forces the Case to take shape and do its job. The inner tube is inflated up to 50 PSI and forces/pinches both tire beads against the wheel. There are several advantages over conventional, mechanical beadlocks. You can use your existing wheels. They lock both the outside and inside tire beads to the wheel. This prevents the inside tire bead from burping air. There are no balance issues. There are no DOT issues, hence they are street legal. The bead locks are wheel size specific, but regarding the tires, no. If kept properly inflated, the beadlock will last you through many sets of tires. Internal bead locks are being used in drag race vehicles in excess of 150 MPH and have been on the Baja 1000 Jeep Speed class winner for several years. They have also been on Paris to Dakar and Outback Challenge winning vehicles throughout the world. There is a 1 year limited warranty on material and workmanship.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[These innovative TeraFlex SpeedBump Bump Stops meet the demand of high-performance driving. Composite construction combined with a progressive nature reduces suspension compression impacts and harshness when bottoming out whether driving off-road or on poorly maintained highways. Reducing this impact increases driver ability to maintain vehicle control as well as reduces the risk of bending an axle housing tube.    Other features include performance-tuned closed-cell nitrogen charged microcellular polyurethane technology that will not fade or dissipate under extended heavy use to maintain its progressive nature. This material is unaffected by temperature extremes and retains its flexibility under thermal or sub-zero temperatures. SpeedBump Bump Stops also feature a self-lubricating Delrin acetal resin polymer shaft to withstand 1,000s of continuous cycles without wear or abrasion. The external shaft seal also prolongs shaft life by wiping and cleaning the shaft to prevent contaminants from entering the SpeedBump housing. The front bump stops feature a simple bolt-on installation simply requires removal of the factory bump stop bell with no welding required.Additionally, these maintenance-free SpeedBump Bump Stops don't require any adjustment or tuning.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The 2.5 inch Lift system for 2014 3500 Rams, with Radius Arm front suspension, features more than just basic spacers. Dodge designed the front coil springs with a large bow to increase vehicle stability and handling. Unlike other flat spacers on the market, Fabtech?s angled spacers retain this important feature preserving the factory ride characteristics. The front shocks are replaced with longer length units to allow for full suspension travel while improving the damping of the front suspension. Extended length bump stops are included in this kit to prevent the coil springs from binding at full compression while also eliminating Trac Bar interference. Use 315/70R17 tires w/ 17x9 wheels w/ 4 5/8? BS w/ minor trimming. Use 325/65R18 tires w/ 18x9 wheels w/ 4 5/8? BS w/ minor trimming. Use 325/60R20 tires w/ 20x9.5 wheels w/ 5?

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[For the extreme off-roader and rock crawler, Fabtech offers the Crawler system. This system will allow use of 37 inch tires for aggressive offroading. The front system is a conversion from the factory 4 link to Fabtech's Radius Arm design. The adjustable Radius Arm links are made of 5/16 inch thick steel for max dent resistance with rotational urethane joints at each end for unrestricted articulation. These Radius Arms mount to a 1/4 inch thick steel crossmember that bolts to the frame under the transmission. The front steering geometry is relocated via a dropped pitman arm. A Trac Bar relocation bracket keeps the arc of travel between the Trac Bar and Drag Link proper to reduce bump steer throughout the suspension travel.Front lift is achieved by either coil springs or coilovers. The rear system retains the factory 5 Link design but with extended length lower tubular arms that bolt to new side frame brackets. The upper links are replaced as well with a tubular style in the factory mounts. Both upper and lower links feature 5/16 inch thick wall links with adjustable rotational urethane ends. The rear Trac Bar is relocated to keep the rear axle tracking with the front axle for superior road handling at high speed. For increased ground clearance at the rear axle, we provide replacement shock mounts that allow trimming of the factory mounts. This allows an additional 1 inch of ground clearance over the factory mounts. We offer heavy duty replacement driveshafts to be used with this system. Exhaust modification required. Use 37/12.50R17 tires w/ 17x8.5 wheels w/ 5? BS w/ minor trimming]]></sales_desc>
