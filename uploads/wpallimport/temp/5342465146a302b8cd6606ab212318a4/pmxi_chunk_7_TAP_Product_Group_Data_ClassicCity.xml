		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Australia's unique driving conditions call for a different approach to shock absorber design. Invariably, vehicles are heavily loaded, fitted with accessories and driven on harsh Outback roads for prolonged periods.When developing shock absorbers, Old Man Emu takes all these factors into consideration. This is reflected in the superb structural integrity of Nitrocharger shocks, along with the fact they are properly valved for the conditions they will be required to work under.This experience in setting the most appropriate valving is what really sets the Nitrocharger apart from its competitors. OME engineers have extensive knowledge in this field as they specialize in nothing else but 4WD suspension systems. When developing a shock absorber, consideration is given to both original equipment and OME springs. In many cases, several shock absorber applications will be listed for one vehicle to ensure the proper match regardless of spring selection, installed accessories or load carrying requirements.While OME Nitrochargers will improve overall ride performance when fitted with standard springs, more substantial benefits can be achieved when fitted in conjunction with OME springs. Improved ride, load carrying characteristics, and wheel travel are all benefits of such a combination.Used by 4 wheelers throughout the world, OME Nitrochargers set the standard in ride comfort over any terrain and simply outperform the competition.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Our shock mounted lights began with the famous KC Daylighter? that we invented and patented in 1972. Not only does the Daylighter? use a heavy-duty rubber gasket (bulb holder) that isolates the lens, reflector, and bulb from the metal housing and elements of weather, but it also includes our patented shock mounting system. The KC HiLiTES shock mounting system was developed as a way to isolate the lamp unit from the mounting bracket or surface to which the light is mounted. This system successfully reduces lamp failure due to vibration and has been proven through the extremes of off road racing. Now, the shock mount system has been updated from the original to require no extra drilling.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Owners of the 2007 and Newer Jeep Wrangler JK who add larger tires and wheels to their vehicles will find that mounting an oversize spare on the stock tire carrier presents a problem. Different wheel offsets space the tire away from the factory rubber stops mounted on the tailgate, which causes annoying rattles and additional stress on the tire carrier. <br>Daystar?s replacement Tailgate Bump Stops kill the rattles permanently. Constructed of Daystar?s unique EVS foam, the Tailgate Bump Stops are a direct replacement for the factory pieces. The Daystar stops thread into the factory locations on the tailgate and are designed to accommodate all tire and wheel packages; simply trim them to fit snugly against the new spare tire. Daystar?s Tailgate Bump Stops require no tools and install in moments. Available in black, the bump stops are sold in pairs (enough for one vehicle). They are an inexpensive solution to a highly annoying problem!]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Daystar Leveling Kits work within the factory suspension design, meaning that we work within the factory's design parameters to achieve an increase in ride height that levels the stance of the vehicle. Because we work within the factory's design, there are not a bunch additional modifications involved. Everything needed is included in the kit; there's everything you need and nothing you don't. If there are extra items required, such as longer shocks, it's clearly stated in the application description. Torsion bar applications require their own unique approach to leveling the stance of the vehicle. With torsion bar applications, we supply new forged torsion keys that meet or exceed factory specifications. These torsion keys have been re-indexed to increase ride height up to 2 inch and level the stance of the vehicle. In select applications, extended shock brackets are also included. Daystar Leveling Kits include only front lift components to level the stance of the vehicle. We also offer Budget Boost kits, which provide a mild increase in ride height and are more economically priced than our Leveling Kits. Since our start with Leveling Kits in 1995 we've used our expertise to develop over 300 applications that span all of the popular trucks and SUVs...do your homework and you'll see that we've done ours!]]></sales_desc>

Aftermarket suspension manufacturers usually neglect these critical bushings whether restoring or lifting factory suspension designs, so add Daystar Sway Bar Bushings to complete the package! Polyurethane sway bar bushings offer less deflection while cornering and outlast factory rubber bushings by a wide margin! These bushings should be considered mandatory when upgrading the suspension on your truck, Jeep, or SUV.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Daystar Poly Flex Control Arms are designed for Jeep enthusiasts by Jeep enthusiasts. Constructed of heavy-gauge tubing, these arms use a combination of our Poly Flex Joints and our Poly Joints to maximize suspension travel and articulation. Poly Flex Joints are a specially designed joint that features a spherical ball encased in a special blend of polyurethane. Housed in a steel outer shell, the joint allows the arms a greater range of control arm movement without binding in its attachment points. Unlike a traditional heim joint, the Poly Flex joint does not make noise and is completely rebuildable. At the other end, our Poly Joint features a Polyurethane bushing that is specially designed to move and deflect as the suspension articulates. Daystar's Poly Flex Control arms are also adjustable to dial in caster and driveline angles. Designed to work on suspensions with 0 inch to 6 inch of lift, the Daystar Poly Flex Control Arms are a beneficial upgrade for any off-road enthusiast.]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[Available in: 12, 14", and 16";Sine wave design;More efficient and quieter blade design"]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[This revolutionary, patent-pending fan blade has greater airflow, is more efficient and is quieter compared to traditional S-blade and straight-blade designs. In fact, the Flex-Wave fan moves up to 20 percent more airflow than Flex-A-Lite Trimline fans, and up to 25 percent more airflow than the comparable electric fans from the competitors! The leading edge of the fan blade is no longer a single, solid line. The sine-wave design creates leading edges that cut through the air first. This starts movement in the air around the blade with greater efficiency. Next, the wave surface of the blades creates channels for the air to move along, producing more airflow and reducing energy losses. The wave surface forms a winglet at the tip of the blade, further increasing efficiency by reducing air vortices. The trailing edge of the fan blade also has variations which reduces wind noise. With this advanced technology in the new Flex-Wave electric fan, Flex-A-Lite is once again leaping ahead of the competition to deliver higher performance cooling products.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Camburg designed this kit to yield maximum usable wheel travel (15-16) being 2.5" wider per side and pushing the wheelbase forward 1" for added tire clearance at the firewall when running 35-37" tires. We've improved front end geometry for better handling and driving characteristics all while being able to be driven on-road with ease as a daily driver. This suspension system is great for tight and technical trail use that requires increased articulation and traction along with higher speed desert use needing bottoming and dampening control with much stronger components that won't leave you stranded in the middle of nowhere.<br><br>Our suspension system is made up of a few key components <br><br>The tubular 4130 chromoly upper arms come standard with poly-urethane bushing at the inner pivot points on the frame. This reduces flexing while under heavy loads and under braking while allowing for reduced friction and zero binding. These are grease-able via zerk fittings and serviceable. We combine this with a large FK 1.50" PTFE lined uniball that adapts to the spindle with heat-treated stainless steel spacers. No modifications or drilling is necessary since the spacers match the taper of the factory ball-joint. This is all through bolted together with a 12pt grade 8 bolt that is recessed in the uniball for a lower profile and cleaner look. We don't use a machined tapered pin that uses a much smaller/weaker bolt to hold it all together. The 1.50" uniball is much stronger, lasts longer and allows for more wheel travel since it has more degrees of rotational movement compared to smaller 1" uniballs. A smaller uniball moves less which means less wheel travel . plain and simple. As an upgrade we also offer the upper arms using FK 7/8" heim joints for race applications and/or for customers looking for added camber and caster adjustment along with our new KINETIK Series billet upper arms.<br><br>CAD designed, CNC laser cut and formed, the lower arms are an internally"]]></sales_desc>

Structural deflection and volume displacement tests have proven the Forged Dynalite to outperform all existing styles of this popular caliper size. Stronger and more reliable due to the forging, the reduced deflection tendencies and resulting decreased fluid volume displacement translate to increased clamping efficiency with less pedal travel. The bottom line is a taller pedal and better stopping power.<br></br>Each caliper is equipped with Wilwood's SRS stainless steel bridge plates and feature high temperature seals and stainless steel pistons to eliminate corrosion and retard heat transfer from the pads. Internal fluid passages eliminate the need for external tubes. Four corner bleed screws assure simple and effective air evacuation from the system and allow one caliper to be mounted in any front, rear, right or left position. These calipers feature Wilwood's signature bright black anodized finish to resist corrosion and maintain their high tech style. These are the same calipers that are used on the Trail-Gear Racing Team's Extreme Rock Crawling competition vehicle. Easy, bolt-on installation.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The K&N Electronic Carburetor Injection, or ECI, is a bolt-on system that adds a supplemental fuel source to your engine. The system consists of a carb spacer plate with a fuel block and injector, an ECU, and a wide band O2 sensor. The plate has a provision for the fuel injector. When needed, the injector squirts atomized fuel into the air stream passing through the spacer plate.In a way, the ECI system works like an EFI system that reads the air/fuel ratio fed to it from an included O2 sensor that you install in your exhaust. Where this differs from EFI, is that it is used in conjunction with the carburetor. Any time the system detects a lean condition, the injector will kick on to bring the AFR back to spec, but the engine is still fed primarily by the carb. The ECI acts as a supplement to your existing carburated setup, rather than a complete replacement system such as EFI or TBI.The brain of the ECI system is the ECU, which vigilantly monitors the input from the oxygen sensor to ensure an optimal air-to-fuel ratio is maintained. If the system detects an AFR higher than the user-defined limit, the injector will fire. Unlike a typical electronic fuel injection system, the ECI works cooperatively with your existing carburetor, supporting the fuel flow rates that high-horsepower vehicles require to operate efficiently. If your engine is performing lean, K&N's ECI system will help make up for the fuel deficit.While users can opt to set only basic parameters if they choose, other more specific parameterslike injector pulse width, shot volume, progressive injector firing, and minimum/maximum RPM rangeare all alterable, making the system extremely versatile.  K&N Electronic Carburetor Injection (ECI) BrainK&N Electronic Carburetor Injection (ECI) Installed K&N's Electronic Carburetor Injection is very easy to install and can be done in a matter of hours, not days like some EFI kits.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Holley HydraMat fuel pickups feature a patent-pending design that solves the problems associated with traditional fuel pickups in stock fuel tanks and racing fuel cells. They greatly reduce the potential for air to enter into the fuel system, which can result in poor engine performance and/or engine stalling. The pickups are perfect for vehicles experiencing fuel starvation during hard cornering, acceleration, stopping, inclines, and low fuel conditions. Surface tension and fluid wicking allow them to continue to draw fuel from the tank or cell even when part of them is uncovered. As an area of the Holley HydraMat fuel pickups is uncovered, tiny pores in the media seal off through surface tension, forcing fuel to be drawn from other areas of the mat where fuel continues to be available. Their unique internal reservoir assists in keeping fuel available at the pickup even under extreme fuel slosh conditions--and they eliminate the need for specialty reservoirs, sumps, and pickup pumps, greatly reducing cost and complexity. They can also act as a 15 micron pre-filter, eliminating the need for a separate filter before the fuel pump, and they can be folded and compressed for easy installation through a variety of fuel cell openings.]]></sales_desc>

Fluted Aluminum Shock Body;Military Grade Hard Anodized Surface;Cooling Surface Area of a 3.0 Coil Over;1.0 inch Nitrotec Shaft;Billet Aluminum Valve Circuit and Components;Dual Spring Rate Slider;Serviceable/Rebuildable/Revalveable ;<b>California Residents: <a href=/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The RRD 2.625 inch Coil Over Shock's fluted aluminum body gives the advantage of weight reduction without sacrificing strength. Which not only make this shock the lightest shock in its class, it also provides a surface area greater than most 3 inch bodied shocks. The fluting provides the structure required to ensure the aluminum cylinders are as strong, if not stronger than their steel 2.5 inch counterparts. The shock bodies are also treated with a military grade hard anodized coating so you never have to worry about corrosion. A high quality DU bearing provides the bearing surface for the massive 1 inch Nitrotec Steel shaft. And unlike chrome plated shafts these Nitrotec steel shafts are bare so you never have to worry about pitting or flaking potentially destroying the seals. While a billet aluminum valve circuit with digressive valving controls the dampening, redundant sealing technology keeps the shock oil where is belongs. The shock oil is formulated for fade-free dampening and smooth rebounds. Its high viscosity index and shear stability controls shock fade. This with a custom moly piston wear band greatly reduces shock body wear.All these features combine to make the RRD 2.625 inch Coil Over Shock a fraction of the weight of the competitions 2.5 inch steel body counterparts and cool twice as fast for fade resistant performance. And all RRD Shocks come with a 6 month Warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[POR-15 Metal Prep provides the best adhesion for POR-15 Rust Preventive Coating on any metal surface, including aluminum and shiny polished metal surfaces. Our simple process gently etches metal, creating an ideal anchor pattern for coatings such as POR-15 Rust Preventive Coating, while simultaneously leaving a zinc phosphate coating to insure chemical bonding of paint and steel. Avoid other preps that may leave harmful residues which prevent proper adhesion. After thoroughly degreasing your work piece, apply environmentally safe POR-15 Metal Prep to both neutralize any rust and etch any clean bare metal. This will allow better adhesion of POR-15 Rust Preventive Coating or any other coating. POR-15 Metal Prep is not caustic, corrosive, toxic or flammable.]]></sales_desc>

This bumper was literally Built For the Hammers" with the best ground clearance, tire clearance and approach angle possible. It is just slightly wider than the Jeep's frame rails, with angled facets to improve its ability to slide over the rocks. The BFH II bumper is CNC laser-cut from high strength 3/16" plate steel, then precision brake-formed for an exact fit. The BFH II bumper features a DOM tube, integrated winch mount, and provisions for mounting the OEM Jeep fog lights.</br><br>Poison Spyder's SpyderShell finish is more than just powder coatingit's a complete system that includes the state of the art in preparation, application, materials and packaging to ensure that your SpyderShell products stay looking great for years. The SpyderShell process has been engineered to provide your Poison Spyder product with years of unmatched great looks, corrosion protection and weather-resistance. Our proprietary 6-stage system starts with media blasting the entire part, to remove contaminents and prep the metal surface for the best possible adhesion. Next, any seams are sealed with 3M Scotch-Weld to block moisture from entering and causing corrosion where the powder can not reach. The first coat to be applied is a zinc-rich powdered black primer, which is baked on to form an impenetrable bond between the metal product and the coating. The primer is black--rather than traditional gray--so that any rock chips or trail damage are less conspicuous. The final top coat is an industrial grade, "super-durable" architectural finish in semi-gloss black, which is engineered to retain its appearance through years of exposure to sun and weather. SpyderShell is a coating process unmatched by any other Jeep armor aftermarket manufacturer, for which we are confident in offering a 5-year warranty on materials and workmanship.</br>"]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Get genuine performance from genuine Spicer. Spicer parts are designed, engineered, and manufactured to meet or exceed OE requirements because they are OE parts, ensuring a perfect fit with our full line of industry-leading axles. That's why Spicer is the name you can trust for top performance and durability. Through heat treating and a slower quality scan rate, Dana is able to deliver a much more consistent and stronger Spicer axle shaft. In addition, the cold-formed rolled spline eliminates the need for machining, which can cause stress fractures and premature failures. And not only are Spicer axle shafts fatigue-tested to last, 100% of our front axle parts are ultrasonically tested, so we're able to check for any internal cracks that regular magnetic testing can't reach. We're proud to claim a safety factor that's high even by OE standardsbecause when it comes to the performance of your axles, there's no room for compromise.<br></br>The same heat treating, slower quality scan rate and cold-formed rolled spline also enable Spicer to deliver a much more consistent and stronger rear axle shaft, with less of the machining that can lead to stress fractures and premature failure. In addition, Spicer rear axle shafts undergo the same fatigue testing and ultrasonic testing, delivering a safety factor that's high even by OE standards.]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[King Shocks offers several options when it comes to safely lifting your vehicle for a tire change, repair work or getting un-stuck.<br>The King screw Jack was conceived as a tough lightweight jacking device to replace awkward and heavy floor jacks carried onboard race vehicles. The King screw jack is a mechanical design that does not rely on hydraulic fluid to lift your vehicle and has a weight capacity of up to 3800 lbs. The screw actuating nut is the same  hex size that your lug nuts use. The screw jack can be raised or lowered by your existing electric impact gun or lug wrench without changing sockets for quick wheel changes. The jacking boss is adjustable up and down on the jack body to compensate for the height of your vehicle. The jacking range is a full 16" to provide enough ground clearance for even the tallest tires.<br>Both the King screw jack and our air jacks are manufactured with the same quality materials and tight tolerances as our race shocks and can be made in custom colors. A King race jack will provide peace of mind and ease of operation when you need it most, don't get caught without one."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Hauk Offroad tube fenders are world-renowned as the best fenders for your JK Wrangler! These monsters are not simply stitched together on the inside like many cheap tube fenders, which allow rust to develop quickly. No, our Hauk Offroad fenders are fully welded the entire length of the outer tube and are made from 1.5 DOM steel tubing and heavy gauge steel with reinforcing gussets, making them the strongest tube fenders available for the JK Wrangler. These also do not bolt to the flimsy outer Jeep skin like other fenders, instead they use spacers where needed to tie into the sub-frame for superior strength. These are available in narrow and factor widths, and 2" or 4" wider than stock fenders! Our 2" Extra Wide Fenders should provide full coverage for a 4.5" backspace wheel fitted in a 12.5" wide tire. If you are running 15.5" tires on a 4.5" backspace then you will need the 4" Extra Wide Fenders for full coverage."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Hauk Offroad Weld-In Sport Cage Kit offers you the increased protection you want! Our high quality kit strengthens the factory cage and allows the use of the factory trim and roll bar padding for a finished, factory look. The kit retains the use of your factory front speakers with an innovative dash plate design. It's made from high grade 1.75 1026 DOM tubing. Includes template and instructions with numerous pictures. Choose from 2 or 4 door JK options. Comes bare steel. Note: In the event of a roll over situation, bolt-on kits do not offer the same protection as a weld-in cage kit. If the bolts were to fail under the vehicle weight, so would the bolt-on cage kit! Hence, we do not offer a bolt-on version of our cage kit as we believe in making our products with the goal to protect, even under extreme trail abuse."]]></sales_desc>
