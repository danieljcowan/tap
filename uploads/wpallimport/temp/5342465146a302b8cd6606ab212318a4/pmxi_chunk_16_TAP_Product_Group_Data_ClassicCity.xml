		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Pro Comp's Pro Runner SS is engineered for late model trucks & SUVs with coilover strut-style, independent front suspensions. Pro Runner SS monotube shocks do more than just improve vehicle ride and handling. They also provide the option of raising the front suspension up to 2.75 depending on application or maintaining the factory ride height and rake thanks to the patent pending 180* SS height adjustable collar. Note: Retains Factory Coil Spring, Coil spring not included.The Pro Runner Monotube shocks deliver the most bang for your buck" when combined with the new Pro Runner Control Arms. At the heart of the shock is the gas-charged monotube design that delivers superior performance compared to traditional twin tube shocks. The brushed and zinc-plated, clear coated monotube body is nitrogen gas pressurized to eliminate performance-robbing cavitation during compression and rebound. This allows the shock to dissipate heat more efficiently. The Vehicle Specific Ride Tuning (VSRT) in each shock was derived using extensive dyno and real world testing. The result is multi-stage valving to optimize the ride and handling characteristics for each application. Whether you are towing a trailer or hitting woops in the desert, you can count on Pro Comp Pro Runner monotubes to give you the confidence behind the wheel."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Heavy Duty Header Bar Kit is a highly recommended addition to the Trail Cage installation. This product fits 2002-2006 TJ/LJ ONLY. The Trail Cage can be installed with the stock header bars, but those are little more than thin-wall tubing intended to brace the windshield, providing little in the way of cage protection. Our Heavy Duty Header Bar Kit replaces them with precision-manufactured, high strength components that work with your stock roll bar and Poison Spyder Trail Cage Kit to provide the strength and safety of a real deal, heavy duty cage. The Heavy Duty Header Bars are made from high strength 1-3/4 X .120 inch wall DOM structural tubing, laser notched and expertly welded to CNC laser cut 3/16 inch mount plates. For comparison, the stock header bars are made of .095 wall welded seam tubing, with thin gauge stamped metal mounting flanges. The DOM tubing used in the Poison Spyder kit has a yield strength of 70,000 psi, with a tensile strength of 44,668 lbs. Compare that to the welded seam tubing of the stock header bars, at 40,0000 psi yield strength and only 19,757 lbs. tensile strength. The Heavy Duty Header Bar Kit may also be installed by itself without the Trail Cage, or with other manufacturer's add-on cage kits.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Poison Spyder Hood Louver helps keep your engine running cool by promoting airflow through the engine compartment. Many factors can contribute to high under-hood temperatures, which can translate to higher engine coolant temperatures and overheating. Headers, slow speeds, flex fans, and the cramped spaces of the engine compartment can all contribute to increased heat and reduced airflow. This Hood Louver kit frees up airflow through the engine compartment, allowing hot air to escape and cooler air to be drawn in through the radiator, improving cooling of both the engine coolant and under-hood air. Rock-crawlers and slow-moving vehicles are especially susceptible, as slower speeds naturally result in reduced airflow. Poison Spyder Hood Louvers are crafted from quality, thick gauge aluminum sheet. They are CNC laser-cut and precision die-stamped. Aluminum makes the hood louver both light weight and corrosion resistant. But its thick enough to add some rigidity to the Jeep's notoriously thin sheet metal hood, helping to reduce hood wobble" at speeds. Hood Louvers are fairly easy to install but do require some drilling and cutting of your hood. Stainless steel fasteners are supplied, as well as a full-size template with instructions for cutting the airflow holes in the hood."]]></sales_desc>

The License Plate Mount uses four of the OE spare tire mount bolts, and is offset to allow proper function of the tailgate vents. If using this item to relocate the license plate, we recommend using the Stock License Plate Delete Cover # PSC17-04-112 to fill the hole where the factory license plate mount was located. NOTE: This item was designed to fit JK's with the wide vent on the tailgate (vent is wider than it is tall). These are generally found on 2010 and newer JK's, however they have also been found on some 2009's. This item may also be used on JK's with the tall tailgate vent (taller than it is wide), which were typically found on 2007-2009 JK's, however the edges of the vent may still be visible above and below the license plate.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Poison Spyder Rear Stinger Tire Carrier is the ultimate rear bumper for hard core rock crawling. Like many Poison Spyder original designs, the Rear Stinger concept has been copied by many manufacturers, but none come close to the quality, function, performance and awesome appearance of the original. Built for light weight, high clearance, ease of use and a measure of rear-flop protection, the Poison Spyder Rear Stinger is designed for those who spend most of their time in the rocks and need a tire carrier that meets the challenge. The Rear Stinger is basically a fold-down spare tire carrier. By pulling the two upper pins, the tire carrier can swing down, making loading and unloading of huge off-road tires easier. Simply roll the tire up into the carrier, secure it with the provided 3-Way Spare Tire Strap, then swing the carrier back up and pin it in place. The main components are fabricated from NC-bent DOM tubing and CNC laser-cut plate steel. NOTE: This product is designed to be installed in conjunction with Poison Spyder Crusher Corners with LED taillights. We do not recommend installing them without Crusher Corners. Other manufacturer's corner protectors may fit, IF they are 3/16 inch thick, however it is likely you would need to drill new holes in the corners as their bolt holes may not line up with ours. This product is not compatible with stock taillight housings.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Deep cryogenic treatment is a one-time process that permanently improves the performance and service life of metals from brake rotors and engine parts, to machine tools and gear sets.

As a light source LED's offer several advantages over their halogen counterparts including very low power consumption, compact size and durability. Unlike most LED lights currently on the market that position the LED aimed straight out forward the LP270 Lights aim the LEDs at the reflector. This new orientation of the light source allows for far better beam control and output than the conventional layout. In place of a traditional halogen bulb each light uses two 3W LEDs producing a very white beam with a color temperature of 6000 Kelvin. LEDs with a computer designed multi-surface reflector gives a true high performance fog pattern in a lightweight, durable light that requires a fraction of the power used by a comparable halogen light.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Old Man Emu suspension systems have always focused on ride quality rather than ride height and this new line of shock absorbers includes some of the latest shock valving technology achieving a whole new level of ride quality.Most dual and monotube shocks typically feature a two-stage valving process, the new OME NitroCharger Sport features a triple-stage valving process rivaled only by a remote canister adjustable shock. We've stacked it into the most durable shock body and adjusted it by load capacity for you. So, rather than offering a single adjustable shock, the OME engineers have done all of the testing and tuning adjustments for you. You get to choose from a selection of shock absorbers for your application based on your load-carrying configuration, guaranteeing an immediate and ideal ride without any costly fine-tuning required post-installation.The monotube style main piston valving improves transition and direction changes while the extra base valving provides more fine-tuning for comfort and control. So, the new OME NitroCharger Sport feels like a monotube without the vulnerability or the high price tag.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[While winch straps sold by ARB are exceptionally strong, it is essential that safety precautions are observed to avoid injury in the event of a failure. One such precaution is the fitting of a recovery damper prior to a load being applied. In the unlikely event of a wire rope or strap failure, the recovery damper will absorb most of the energy in the cable or strap, significantly reducing the recoil. ARB?s recovery damper is manufactured from heavy duty vinyl and features storage pockets which come in handy for carrying snatch blocks and shackles when walking from your 4WD to an anchor point. As recovery dampers are now mandatory accessories for most 4WD competitions, the ARB damper exceeds minimum competition weight requirements.]]></sales_desc>
