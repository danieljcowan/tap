We were the first to introduce these innovative coolers over 20 years ago. Our coolers are guaranteed to never leak or sweat because of our high quality TPU liner, stronger and eco-friendly. The inner insulation is three-quarters of an inch thick, high-density, closed cell foam. The combination creates a cooler that will hold ice for 24 hours in 120-degree heat. With our soft exterior, it won't scratch up your gel coat or tear up any upholstery. Because of our confidence in this product we guarantee the coolers for life. If it ever leaks we'll replace the liner. Tested, used, and sold by many of the performance boating industries and top manufacturers. This cooler will be the best cooler you will ever purchase.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Daystar Products now offers a simple and economical way to upgrade a standard winch roller fairlead to work with any synthetic rope. Daystar?s Rope Rollers replace the steel rollers on any conventional fairlead so you can retain the benefits of a roller fairlead while running synthetic winch rope. <br><br>Synthetic winch rope is rapidly becoming standard equipment on trail rigs because it offers several performance and safety advantages over conventional winch cable. However, there are unseen costs associated with converting a winch to use synthetic rope. The steel rollers on a conventional roller fairlead are not compatible to synthetic rope because they can cause chafing and abrasion. Most rope manufacturers recommend using an aluminum Hawse-type fairlead. These fairleads can cost over $100, not to mention the extra time and hassle of installation. Further, some bumper designs are not compatible with a Hawse type fairlead. <br><br>Daystar?s Rope Rollers are constructed of durable polyurethane material for superior chafing resistance. Polyurethane provides a smooth surface for the rope to slide against while being virtually unbreakable. Designed to withstand the tremendous forces that a modern winch can dish out, the Rope Rollers will not groove or gall during angled pulls.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The second offering in the 600 Series is the MR606 Mesh. Staying true to the 600 Series philosophy, the MR606 takes the ultra clean styling of the MR306 Mesh wheel and exaggerates it. This wheel is going to be another contender for the deep dish club boasting a 3 lip on the 20x10s and 5" lip on the 20x12s. Cleaning things up a bit around the outside, the MR606 features a more conventional non-beadlock lip design while still including removable stainless steel bolts. Center cap duties are taken care of via a bolt-on aluminum center ring with a snap in cap with raised Method logo for 5 & 6 lug, while a bolt on piece will cover 8 lug applications. To hammer it home, a second Method logo is subtly debossed into one of the spokes. Don't mistake the clean and simple design for weakness, the MR606 features the same 2650 lb. load rating for 5 & 6 lug applications and 3640 lbs. for 8 lug."]]></sales_desc>

Method's signature Street-Loc' lip is standard on the one-piece wheel and includes removable stainless steel bolts around the lip. For those who are after a deep-dish look, this is going to be a contender. The 20x10 has a 3 lip and the 20x12 has a 5.25" lip. A bolt-on aluminum center ring houses a snap in cap with a raised Method logo for 5 & 6 lug applications with a bolt-on cap for 8 lug. Around the bolt circle are two massive debossed Method logos.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Tribute is a UTV series front sand tire from Sand Tires Unlimited that was designed to be used with the 4wd featured on side by sides. These tires offer increased steering response and improved flotation while not sacrificing it Foots hill climbing abilities in the sand over a set of front smoothies or knobby desert tires. The Tribute features multiple offset ridges to increase side bite for improved steering without digging too much into the sand or increasing roll resistance. This improves the UTV Foots steering response and reduces understeer. What the Tribute also features that the Razor Back series tires does not have are mini paddles. These mini paddles allow for you to use 4wd in the sand with a set of rear paddles and avoiding having to run a set of high drag desert tires in the front. The advantage of using 4wd over 2wd with a set of front smooth tires on a UTV is improved hill climbing, acceleration, more precise steering and increased stability. The small paddles also throw very little sand compared to front desert tires. The Tribute is sold uncut and has paddles facing in both directions. The tires can be ran as is, but it Foots recommended for better performance to do a competition cut that removes every other paddle. Doing this cut turns the tire into an asymmetrical tire that can only be ran in one direction]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Rough Country's Exhaust Extensions are a crucial component to lifting new model Wranglers 2in or more. These easy to install spacers are fitted between the head-pipe and cross-pipe flanges, effectively moving the exhaust rearward toward the crossmember. Standard, there is insufficient room between the front drive shaft and exhaust pipes, leaving an unextended exhaust to make contact with the drive shaft in downward suspension travel. These durable exhaust spacers are made of 2in cold rolled steel exhaust tubing, flared to nest perfectly within the flanges. By extending the cross-pipe, you gain more than twice the clearance in this crucial area allowing for proper installation of any lift of 2in or more. Recommended to use in conjunction with an aftermarket front drive shaft for 4 - 6in kits to maintain optimum clearance and articulation.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Be the Boss and take control of your air with the M3 Big Boss Pack complete with M3 pumper, variable air speed controller and (2) pumper hoses. The all new M3 (MAC3.2) takes helmet air pressure to a new level. With the constant demand for more air flow in pumper style helmets, the M3 builds pressure and forces high volume air at a much higher rate of speed. Using a special built high static pressure fan the M3 produces 5 times the pressure and more volume than any other helmet pumper available! Built from light weight carbon fiber and 6061 billet aluminum the M3 is a feather weight at only 1.6 pounds. Small, compact and easy to mount with our exclusive half clamp bar mounts available in most tubing sizes. Eliminate the dust with the purpose built washable dry media filter with Outerwear particulate wrap. Run the entire race with one filter then simply wash in water so you're ready for the next event. No more losing air because of a clogged filter! Matched with Rugged Radios VSC (Variable Speed Controller) the M3 can be turned down for staging then instantly turned up for high pressure ventilation. The VSC pulse control precisely adjusts the amount of air entering the helmet. From start to finish the M3 is built to race. High pressure, high volume, light weight construction, micron air filtering system, and waterproof connectors make the M3 the ultimate in helmet pumper systems. Keep cool and breathe clear with the new powerful M3 Helmet Pumper System from Rugged Radios!]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[This is a mandatory upgrade when running fiberglass front fenders. The problem you run into when installing fiberglass fenders is you lose the factory inner fenders which exposes the engine smog/air pump and its inlets. This allows dirt and water to enter which damages the pump and is a very expensive fix not covered under warranty. This kit relocates the inlets to inside the engine bay area and uses K&N filters to insure water and dirt is kept out. We use XRP hose and fittings that match up to our aluminum bracket that holds the filters. This bracket bolts to the inner sheet metal using supplied hardware and drill template]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Bringing your canine companion along for a Jeep ride is really what it's all about. In the past, this has meant one of two things. Letting you four-legged friend run free inside the cab of the Jeep or lock them up inside a conventional pet carrier. The Rugged Ridge C4 Canine Cube aims to change all that. Our unique soft-side design suspends from the sport bar and anchors itself to the factory floor hooks- a design so innovative that the canine carrier folds flat to the floor when not in use and can be reconfigured in moments. Constructed from heavy-duty ballistic weave fabric with mesh-screened walls, the C4 Canine Cube keeps your pet safely contained inside while permitting good visibility and air flow to your prized passenger. Plastic-reinforced floor panels provide an added layer of protection to your interior carpet and trim while UV-resistant materials resist fading. The C4 Canine Cube for 2007-2018 Wrangler JK is an ideal complement to our C3 Rear Cargo Cover for comprehensive cargo area protection that keeps your pets best interests in mind.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The ultimate way to enjoy the true Jeep open air experience with friends is with a Bimini Top Plus from MasterTop.  The easy on/easy off Bimini Top Plus design provides protection from the weather for both driver and passenger as well as any back seat passengers while traveling during those warm spring and summer months.  These summer soft tops feature no drill installation directly to your sport bar using straps, buckles and hook & loop fasteners.  Unlike other low cost Bimini style tops, all can be used with sport bar mounted grab handles and a unique over the door mount for those Jeeps with factory soft top door surrounds (97- current models only).  Each Bimini Top/Bimini Top Plus attaches to the front of your Jeep with a required windshield channel on 87-95 Jeep Wranglers and a no drill Windshield Header for 97-current Wranglers.  MasterTop offers these channels and headers so make sure you are covered when you order.  All MasterTop Black Diamond Bimini tops and Bimini Top Plus use up-graded 28 oz Sail Cloth fabric for the ultimate in durability and great looks.  This is a MasterTop exclusive feature found in no other aftermarket summer soft top! Why MasterTop Bimini Tops? In this highly competitive category, other manufacturers have reduced the quality of the fabric and designs to the point where it is almost impossible to find a Summer Accessory made with original equipment approved fabrics.  In an effort to reduce cost (and unfortunately, quality), manufacturers have all gone to an imported very low grade of fabric.  This inferior fabric does not match your soft top, rips easier and has inconsistent color and textures.  At MasterTop we continue to provide the products with the quality you have come to expect from a premium manufacturer.  We use only original equipment approved fabrics in our summer soft goods (excluding ShadeMaker Mesh Products) to ensure you only get the best product available."]]></sales_desc>

This durable vinyl coated storage bag has two protective slots with a soft center section to keep your Freedom panels protected from scratches and dents.  The unique outside strap system allows you easily attach the bag to the back of the rear seat headrests and lower cargo ring attachment providing compact storage.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Due to the aerodynamics of a Jeep, wind and rain flows over the top of the vehicle and back inside the cab while driving without a top or with a Bimini style top.  This backdraft can blow air, rain and items inside the Jeep forward creating a real mess.  The MasterTop Zip Down Wind Stopper creates a barrier to this back draft keeping the inside cab dry and warm.  Constructed of Durable Original equipment approved fabric with an ultra-clear press polished window, the Wind Stopper is a must for those open air driving adventures. Each Wind Stopper easily attaches to the factory sport bar using heavy duty nylon straps and buckles.  This ease of installation allows the Wind Stopper to be kept on the vehicle during the winter months keeping the warm air inside the front cab.  This is the perfect all season accessory!  Each MasterTop Wind Stopper features an exclusive zippered window for added airflow during those hot summer days.  Only MasterTop Wind Stoppers feature a built in zippered rear flap that can easily be attached to a MasterTop Tonneau Cover for the ultimate summer soft top combination.  Each Wind Stopper runs below the top of the body line except 4 door Wrangler models that come down to the optional Tonneau cover.  This abbreviated" 4 door version attaches behind the rear seat providing wind protection for both front and rear passengers. All MasterTop Black Diamond Wind Stoppers use up-graded 28 oz Sail Cloth fabric for the ultimate in durability and great looks.  This is a MasterTop exclusive feature found in no other aftermarket summer soft top!  Why MasterTop Wind Stoppers? In this highly competitive category, other manufacturers have reduced the quality of the fabric and designs to the point where it is almost impossible to find a Summer Accessory made with the original equipment fabric.  In an effort to reduce cost (and unfortunately, quality), manufacturers have all gone to an imported very low grade of fabric.  This inferior fabric does not match yo"]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[A key component in a vehicle's suspension system, the ball joint has a round, ball-like head that swivels inside a cup-like socket. Usually there are four ball joints in a car's front suspension, with an upper and lower joint fixed to each wheel. Depending on the wear pattern on the suspension system, it can be necessary to replace one, two, or all four ball joints. Upper ball joints are also used in some 4WD drive vehicles with solid axles. In a solid axle assembly, the upper ball joint connects the knuckle to the axle. The upper ball joint consists of a heat-treated ball stud, mounted inside a steel housing. This ball stud can swing and rotate inside the housing, which allows the spindle or knuckle to pivot. Greasing the ball joint on a regular basis will greatly increase the life of the part. Lower ball joints are used in some 4WD drive vehicles that have also solid axles. In the case of a solid axle application, the lower ball joint connects the knuckle to the axle. The lower ball joint consists of a ball stud that is mounted into a steel housing. The ball stud can swing and rotate inside the housing, which also allows the spindle or knuckle to pivot. Greasing the ball joint on a regular basis will greatly increase the life of the part. Ball joints will clear RCV axle shafts.]]></sales_desc>

No cutting, cussing involved. The other guys claim an enlarged wheel well opening, ours truly do. We move the rear of the wheel well opening nearly 2 inch closer to the firewall to actually give you the largest wheel opening possible. We remove the factory fender to firewall brace to accomplish this, the others maintain this bracket so how are their wheel openings bigger? They're not.<br><br>  TNT full replacement tube fenders allow for the use of all stock under-the-hood accessories. Once the fenders are installed the components will tell you where they need to go. Every popular Jeep Wrangler TJ or LJ model (base to Rubicon) has been tested and can be done with no more than simple hand tools and a drill. When installing TNT tube fenders you will be required to use our battery tray (included). As an added bonus TNT tube fenders ship with a package tray for the drivers side to allow mounting of aftermarket accessories such as an air compressor. Have ARB lockers? We've already pre-punched the small ARB compressor mounting bolt pattern in the package tray to minimize your install time.]]></sales_desc>

The horns' characteristic sound is produced by repeatedly striking a rivet in the center of a spring-steel diaphragm with the teeth of a rotating cogwheel. Even small klaxons can be noisy, and louder models are devastating in close quarters. This sound is the preferred choice for town evacuation alarms. This horn produces a hefty 112 dB and will be recognized everywhere you go. The horn features a simple two wire hookup and runs from your cars 12v battery (terminals and mounting studs included).

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Unlike any others on the market, Bartact keeps its military production background in mind. All of the seat covers are not only built to last with the highest grade waterproof-backed polyester, but they also have a unique storage design implemented. Oh yeah, just like all of Bartact's products, they are 100% Made in the U.S.A.<br><br>Another benefit of Bartact seat covers is the fit and feel. Unlike many others, because of Bartact's expertise derived from military production expertise, they are able to create the most near-perfect fit designed to look and feel like a re-upholstered seat. Finally, while others may offer a one year anti-fade material, Bartacts is guaranteed not to fade for 3 years minimum.<br><br><strong>Color warranty note:</strong> coyote, olive drab, acu camo, and multicam are U.S. made cordura nylon, and the same fabric Bartact uses for military products. However, due to the fact that these are nylon, it is not possible to add UV inhibitors in the milling of the fabric, so there is no 3 year anti-fade warranty on those colors.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Looking for the best? Our Camburg TIG shackles replace the stock light-duty version your 10-14 Ford Raptor or 09-14 F-150 is equipped with from the factory. The stock shackles are stamped out of thin metal and use a rubber bushing which both allow for a flexy component that also binds as it cycles since the rubber bushings are vulcanized into the shackle.<br><br>Our TIG shackles are a fabricated boxed gusseted design from 4130 chromoly  that is much stronger than mild steel and use polyurethane bushings that pivot smoother with less flex. We TIG weld them, bead blast the surfaces then powdercoat them our trademark Camburg steel gray color. They are  ready to be bolted on using the factory hardware. These are available in a stock length, so they do not raise or lower the ride height or an 1.5 extended version that will lower the ride height about 1. Both are designed for stock and Deaver leaf springs, the stock length versions do not work with icon leaf springs."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Are you squinting to see through a cracked spider webbed front windshield? Why not replace it with one of Low Range's Glass or Lexan Polycarbonate Windshields. <br><br>Which is better for you?<br><br>The Lexan Polycarbonate Windshield is 250% stronger than glass and will never break. It has a scratch resistant coating and produces less glare than glass. It also has a higher R" rating so it holds in more heat in the winter and does not let heat in as much in the hot summer. If you roll the rig and bend the frame, the poly shield will pop out rather than break and send glass into your face. <br>So why do they still sell glass shields? Glass will hold up better if your using it for mudding when you will be getting gritty mud up there and using your wipers. Glass resists scratches better.  It also goes without saying that you should check local laws.  Glass is often required by local highway laws. <br><br>Both shields include a new rubber seal.<br>Note: Polycarbonate windshields are optically clear. Glass windshields have a DOT compliant OEM-style green solar tint that reduces glare and cuts the amount of infrared and UV radiation that comes through the windshield."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[RIGID revolutionized the lighting industry with the RDS Series, the world's first curved light bar. The new RDS SR-Series PRO offers the same great styling and functional advantages of the RDS Series in a more streamlined package. The SR-Series has always provided a sleek, low-profile lighting solution that measures less than 2 inches tall. By treating the proven design to a gentle arc, the RDS SR-Series PRO is right at home in modern bumpers, windshields, grille inserts, and other applications where a curve look is more complimentary than that of a traditional light bar. The curve is for more than just looks, it is also functional: the arc of the RDS SR-Series PRO light bar provides a wider spread of light, providing unmatched lighting coverage with a single light bar. The bar offers the same quality extruded aluminum housing and unbreakable polycarbonate lens as other RIGID products, but it now packs more light output than ever thanks to PRO LEDs with more raw lumens. More than just functional, new blacked out circuit boards and updated branding further enhance the RDS SR-Series PRO's sleek and subtle look. Built with the same quality components as the rest of RIGID's lighting products, the new RDS SR-Series PRO provides reliable and efficient lighting on demand.]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[Putting in lower transfer case gears and really getting on the throttle can sometimes damage the front output shaft. This results in a loud popping noise under load and is detrimental to the life of the output shaft. Repeated popping of the front output shaft gear will result in gear failure and loss of power to the front axle. In 1993 Suzuki upgraded the output shaft and stopped using the older style shaft that was prone to failure. These later style shafts are a drop in replacement for 1986-1989 transfer cases. This upgrade is especially good for transfer cases that have lower than stock gearing in them because the lower the gear, the higher the toque load going through the gear. The front output gear can be installed without full disassembly of the transfer case. Only the front output cover needs to be removed to install this gear.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The CURT extended view tow mirror does just what its name suggests: it extends your view when towing. Quickly mounting on your side mirror, the tow mirror instantly adds five to seven and a half inches to your mirror, opening up your view behind your vehicle and minimizing blind spots. Also, because the tow mirror is fully adjustable, it does not merely make your side mirror larger, but it pivots, angles and rotates to give you the perfect view you need to see around that extra-large load and safely tow to your destination.The CURT tow mirror is extremely versatile, being able to mount onto any mirror between 4 and 11" tall. This makes it a useful extension for most vans, trucks and SUVs as well as other vehicles if needed. Because of the extended view tow mirror's versatile design and fully articulating head, it can be used on either the driver side or passenger side, whichever is more useful for your towing setup. It can also be positioned vertically or horizontally. For added visibility and safety while towing, the CURT extended view tow mirror is a lifesaver."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[<br>Poison Spyder Customs Front Stingers are not the same look-alike rectangular Jeep bumper. The stinger is a sturdy and functional bumper built for today's extreme trails. Stingers assist in minimizing damage during a rollover by helping to protect hood line, radiator, and engine. Additionally preventing potential end-overs when heading down steep terrain. The Stinger also protects the grill and winch with no loss in approach angle typical of bulky square bumpers.<br><br> Poison Spyder Front Stingers come in two types: Trail and Competition. Both types are built on a base plate laser cut from 3/16 inch plate steel, with a Stinger hoop made of CNC-bent 1-3/4 inch X .120 wall DOM structural tubing. The Trail Stinger's main hoop stands 27 inch from its base at a 47 angle. The Competition Stinger's main hoop stands 36 inch from its base at a 45 angle.<br><br>Stingers do NOT include winch mounting provisions. Stingers will work with any manufacture's winch mount plate. OE tow hooks will work in conjunction with Poison Spyder's Trail Stinger; If a stronger recovery point is desired check out Poison Spyder's D-Ring Shackle Tabs. Relocation of any bumper-mounted auxiliary lights is required. Poison Spyder offers a Fairlead Light Mount to relocate auxiliary lights to the top of the roller or hawse winch fairlead.<br><br>Trail and Comp Stingers are designed to bolt directly onto an OE frame using OE mounting hardware. Comp stingers may be reinforced with horizontal support tubes as shown in the photo at left, however these are not included in the kit. Stingers are shipped bare steel.<br>]]></sales_desc>
