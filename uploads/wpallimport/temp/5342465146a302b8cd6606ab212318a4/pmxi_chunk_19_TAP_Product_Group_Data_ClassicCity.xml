		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Bilstein's technically superior, patented monotube gas charged design allows the excessive heat from the oil to transfer to the outer surface of the shock body and dissipate more efficiently. The dividing piston also permits the oil to expand as heat builds, preventing aeration (foaming) and viscosity loss. This allows the shock to maintain full damping characteristics as temperatures rise.The tube of a Bilstein Gas Pressure Shock Absorber is fabricated using a special extrusion method. This process achieves an extremely tight peak-to-valley tolerance and maintains consistent wall thickness. Bilstein's seamless monotube design provides superior tube strength while maximizing heat dissipation and shock life.The piston head design allows independent tuning of the compression and rebound damping forces to provide optimum ride comfort and performance without compromise. It features fewer parts than most conventional twin tube and so called  inch inchroad sensing inch inch shock designs. This simple, yet exceptionally functional digressive design contributes to the extreme durability and long life of Bilstein Shock Absorbers.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Clover Patch Convert-A-Top enables you to travel in open air comfort. With the top up, and windows out, it stops the annoying flapping noise coming from your sail panels. The Convert-A-Top folds up your sail panels and safely stores them. Two straps put tension on the rear bow so your top is tight and flap free. Fits 1992-2007 Wranglers. Does not fit TJ Unlimited or JK 4 door. Your Jeep's noise level is greatly reduced at highway speeds, with the side and rear windows out, making conversation and listening to the radio possible. No more stopping in order to attach a sail panel that has become detached. With the sail panels up and out of the way visibility is greater and the sail panel is protected during off-roading.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Bubba Rope is deicated to making the safest and best recovery gear in the USA.  We take our products and our customers seriously while having fun in what we do. We created Bubba Rope as a fun life-style array of high quality American made products. Our one-of-kind snatch rope is adapted from military specifications and has been tested commercially for years, pulling out work trucks and heavy equipment from muddy job sites. Recreational 4x4s, ATVs and other off road vehicles can benefit from this kinetic energy technology to get unstuck faster and safer. What makes Bubba Rope unique is our process of dipping our double braided nylon rope in liquid vinyl in a trademarked Gator-ize process. This coating is what gives Bubba Rope its water, abrasion and UV resistant properties and ultimately a longer life span. Also, unlike other recovery rope companies Bubba Rope does not have others make our products and just put our name on it. Every Bubba Rope is made in our USA factory with our own trained master splicing technicians. Our main goal is to continue to make the best recovery rope and the best recovery gear ever! We hope you enjoy using them as much as we do creating them.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Back in the day, it was downright shameful for a truck to show the backside of its tires in public. There wasn't a truck in town that'd be caught dead flinging its dirt and gravel in every which direction without a care in the world. But things have changed since then. ARIES knows there's a time and a place for everything these days, and as such, our mud flaps are built with a universal design and a quick-release, pull-pin removal system. The universal bracket on each ARIES mud flap features four holes that allow it to be mounted on pretty much any truck or SUV, bolting right onto the frame and offering a solid installation. The mud flap then uses a quick-release pull-pin to be attached or detached from your truck any time, whether it's appropriate or not. ARIES removable universal mud flaps also feature strong carbon steel construction, a durable powder coat finish and are sold in pairs.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[These transmission kits increase line pressure in the transmission, which reduces torque converter and transmission clutch slippage and improves shifting. Easy to install using basic hand tools. Bully Dog's shift enhancers improve shift and line pressure while reducing slipping and lowering heat. The end result is firmer, quicker shifts which vastly improves the driving experience and longevity of the transmission by lowering transmission temperatures. The Allison Shift Enhancer is the simplest, most effective kit available without having to pull the transmission. It literally gives the clutches more traction in the clutch packs. It allows for a quicker shift and 50 hp worth of additional holding power for the Allison 1000, 2000 and 2400 transmissions.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[In high torque, high-load situations, the torque converter bears the brunt of the engine?s force. Stock torque converter stator pitch designs slip excessively, causing the oil to foam and ever heat, and the front cover clutch surface to warp. But BD?s torque converter was specifically designed to handle the kind of punishment you dish out. Built on our premises in a state-of-the-art transmission facility, BD converters feature a heavy duty stamp forged steel cover, much thicker than stock and it is actually stronger than steel billet. We double the amount of lock up clutch material of a stock unit. We furnace braze the turbine and impellor fins to prevent internal leakage, turbine and lock up piston are balanced separately and then as a complete assembly. Turbine to impellor clearance and over all convertor height is verified. Our own cast aluminum stator design maximizes the low-speed torque characteristics of the Cummins engine and we even have high rpm stall stators for those race applications.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Just one look at the Rugged Ridge AmFib Snorkel System for Wrangler JL & Gladiator JT models and you know this is not your typical snorkel. We designed the Low Mount Snorkel to make a visual splash by devising a base that blends seamlessly with the factory cowl panel and then topped it off with a low air intake that instantly becomes the focal point that you can't take your eyes off of. While making such a big splash is great, our quest for a superior snorkel went far beyond the visual. We engineered the entire AmFib snorkel inside the Jeep to literally make waves, by designing a system that is over-engineered to be less invasive, performs better and installs easier than any snorkel we've ever built before. The entire system and its components look at-home, as though they we're part of the Jeeps original design. But where the rubber really meets the road is where the AmFib Snorkel truly shinesQuickly swap the low air intake for the High Mount Intake and you can defy water crossings with total confidence.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Dusty trail rides and deep water fordings, anyone who takes their Jeep off-road is likely to encounter these conditions someday. The new Modular XHD Snorkel System from Rugged Ridge relocates the vulnerable stock air intake location to help reduce dust clogged filters and the risk of hydro-locking your engine. It is the first and currently only snorkel designed with the modular functionality of a pre-filter Low Mount and Ram High Mount air intake design. Unlike other snorkels, you dont have to give up flexibility for functionality. The Modular XHD Snorkel System comes standard with a Low Mount pre-filter and the Ram High Mount extension. The Low Mount pre-filter relocates the intake below the windshield, drawing cool air from outside the hot engine bay. The Ram High Mount extension moves the intake up an additional 21 inch to the top of the windshield. The two air intake mounts are easily interchangeable to give you the modular functionality best suited to your needs. The system is manufactured from durable heavy gauge plastic, mandrel bent aluminum and hi-temp silicone connecting hoses. The built-in manual drain valves channel away excess water to prevent it from entering the intake system. This snorkel installs with minor modifications to the fender, but without the major cutting and surgery that other kits require. The new lower air cleaner box installs in place of the factory unit, so you dont have to  inchhack and tap inch.]]></sales_desc>

Our unique formula prevents deposits that can cause overheating. Lower cylinder head temperatures means advanced ignition time and more horsepower. One bottle treats 12-20 quarts of a 50/50 water antifreeze mix. Two bottles are required for straight water coolant. For passenger cars, light trucks and SUV's use every 30,000 miles. For racing applications use every race as needed.]]></sales_desc>
