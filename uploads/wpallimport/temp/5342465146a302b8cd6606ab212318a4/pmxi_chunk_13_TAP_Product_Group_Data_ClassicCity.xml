		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Unlike other lifts available on the market that make you disassemble the strut assembly for installation, this lift kit is designed to fit on top of the strut. Why do we do it this way? Because the other lifts can pre-load the spring, making your ride harsher- and they are more difficult to install. Many people who have installed the in-the-strut poly spacers in the past have come to us and asked us why their poly spacers are squeezing out of the strut assembly...its because other lifts aren't designed to take that kind of abuse. You may ask, why don't we make the spacers out of steel like all other leveling kits on the market? We have found that over time, the other steel" sandwiched/ welded spacers will flex and the steel will rust, and the tolerances on the holes and components are not as tight as we would like. Over time, the other lifts would "pop" meaning the struts begin to move on the spacers. Aluminum used as a strut spacer has proven to be the best material, because it will not rust and has the best characteristics for a spacer of this size. We have done our homework here and come up with an easy to install lift (in 2-3 hrs), with more engineering and components than other lifts have."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Low Range's efforts were motivated by repeated transfer case breakage after installing low range t-case gears. The factory brackets are made of thin sheet metal with only 4 points of contact on each side of the case. High torque situations or simply letting out the clutch too fast in low range can cause the mounts to bend, which in turn causes pulling or breaking of the soft aluminum transfer case.  In addition, the factory brackets attach to the frame itself in only 3 places creating additional vulnerability. Other aftermarket cradles do not address the transfer case's rigidity problems and use only factory mounting locations to attach their cradle to the case.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Low Range Offroad's blocks are CNC cut and machined from solid 6061-T6 billet aluminum, with a CNC machined pressed in steel locating stud. By their machining and press technique, they achieve what cannot be matched in todays market- ACCURACY.<br><br>This 1 degree taper is machined in the block with a CNC Machined F" indicating which way the block is installed in the vehicle. Why a taper? They have found that with a 1 degree taper we achieve the least drive train vibration. They have worked closely with dealerships to make sure the best possible product is installed on customer vehicles.<br><br>These blocks provide 1" of rear lift when used with a 3" front leveling spacer.  When the front is lifted more than the rear weight shifts back a bit more on the rear springs.  In order to get 1" of lift their blocks are slightly taller than 1".   When used without a front lift their blocks give 1.25" of rear lift."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Stock or typical aftermarket Suzuki Samurai clutches are fine for normal, lighter-duty usage, but wear and performance can be significantly impacted by more extreme conditions. In such cases, a ceramic clutch is a great upgrade. Ceramic has properties that surpass the performance of woven glass or organic materials. Not only does ceramic last longer, but its performance doesn't degrade as it wears. In addition, ceramic delivers the same level of performance whether hot or cold. This kit offers a much higher coefficient of friction than your factory clutch and increased friction equals more power to the wheels.]]></sales_desc>

The 6 lift Alpine CT6 builds on the 4" lift Alpine CT4 by adding a heavy-duty drag link flip kit and heavy-duty frame brace kit to correct steering geometry, eliminate front end shimmy, and reinforce the frame.<br><br>Our fully adjustable Alpine flexarms have been engineered to allow tuning of the pinion and caster angles, anti-squat geometry, and tire position as well as optimize front and rear roll centers. The heavy-duty adjustable front track bar and rear track bar bracket eliminate side-to-side movement. Alpine flexarms feature dependable and maintenance-free bushings. The gusseted and reinforced bracketry reduces noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) compared to other longarm kits.<br><br>All of this adds up to provide full suspension articulation and flex off-road along with superior ride quality and performance on road as well as minimal brake dive and squat under acceleration to better put the power down on any surface."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Flash Integrated Scale Ball Mount features a mechanical tongue scale built into the ball mount that measures the tongue weight of your trailer load, providing safer, more confident towing.<br><br>Towing a trailer with too light or too heavy of a tongue weight can be dangerous and result in an accident. Light tongue weight can cause the trailer to suddenly sway violently and cause a loss of control. Heavy tongue weight can cause unnecessary squat in the rear of the tow vehicle and raise the front of the tow vehicle up or cause tire failure. These can result in loss of tow vehicle steering and breaking capabilities and can cause a loss of control and accidents.<br><br>When loading a trailer, the tongue weight should be 10-15% of the total trailer weight. The Flash ISBM makes it easy to know if your trailer is loaded properly by showing how much of the trailer weight is on the tongue. With a properly balanced load, you can enjoy improved steering, better braking control and reduced trailer sway.<br><br>Easy height and ball adjustments make it the perfect solution for towing multiple trailers, and the aircraft-grade aluminum gives you unmatched strength and durability. The Flash ISBM easily handles the heaviest of loads, at about half the weight of comparable steel ball mounts. This makes carrying, adjusting, and installing your Flash ISBM easy and comfortable.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Introducing the new Bartact Base Line Performance Seat Covers (Headrest covers sold separately)...Proudly Made in the U.S.A.  Bartact now has a more economical version of its seat covers, still retaining all of the quality materials available in the Tactical seat covers, but with a few differences.  The Base Line Performance covers are only available in black and graphite.  They also do not have the PALS/MOLLE system like Bartact Tactical covers do.  The Base Line version is made to be more streamlined and repel water even better than the tactical covers, due to the fact that Bartact eliminated all stitching on the fronts, meaning water can only penetrate the covers at the stitching on the edges.  Base Line Series Covers have maintained the snug fitment, since that is one of the most important aspects of a good seat cover.  Bartact also kept its 1/4 high grade foam and scrim backing in order to protect your seats underneath.  Buying loose seat covers without padding leaves you prone to seat wear from the seat covers sliding around.  You don't have to worry about that with any Bartact seat covers."]]></sales_desc>

Based on an aluminum extrusion, the hard anodized shock body will dissipate heat 30% faster than a steel body shock absorber. M 9300 Black Hawk shock absorbers use 4 IFMVs (Incremental Bypass Flow Metering Valve), with 10 adjustable positions to perfectly adjust the rebound and compression damping. 9300 Black Hawk shock absorbers utilize a 3 inch ID piston bore and an ACV (Anti-Cavitiation Valve), which is housed in a 4.5 inch OD remote reservoir. The ACV allows the shock absorber to operate with much lower gas pressure to eliminate oil cavitation. With the ACV, 9300 Black Hawk shock absorbers can fully function at 70-90 PSI which improves the overall durability and comfort. These shock absorbers are completely owner rebuildable and revalvable with service parts readily available. 9300 Black Hawk shock absorbers will provide the most advanced technology found in an off-road racing shock absorber today.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[These rocker guards are designed for those Jeep owners that want some rocker protection, but don't want to drill any holes into the vehicles body.  They are made using 18 gauge aluminum and are simply adhered to the vehicles rocker panel using provided double sided tape.  The rocker guards serve as a fantastic protector against shoe scuffs, road debris and covers up the ugly pinch seem along the bottom of the body panels.  Please note that these rocker guards are designed to work with the Hyline Offroad JK Rock Sliders (P/n's 400.300.100 and 400.300.110).  They will however work with other steps and/or rock sliders, but some light modification may have to be done to trim the rocker guards just around the pinch seam mounting brackets.  They are NOT for use with OEM Rubicon Rock Rails.  The rocker guards already come finished with lightly textured black powder coat.  PROUDLY MADE 100% IN USA.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[There's little doubt that the traditional farm jack is a handy piece of equipment to have when you're driving off road. You can use it to move your vehicle out of awkward situations, lifting vehicles to fill in voids beneath the tires or even as a bead breaker when you have to make a tire repair. But, as we all know, farm jacks can be dangerous. They're inherently unstable and there are countless YouTube videos of users getting injured from a rogue handle or getting their hands caught between the handle and the body of the jack. With this problem in mind, ARB's team of engineers was determined to come up with a better solution to the unsafe farm jack problem. The focus was to design a safer and easier mechanical jack while being lighter and more compact. Adding a new dimension to traditional techniques, the long-travel ARB JACK is backed by the unique power of hydraulic technology. Kicking into action when even the lightest force is applied to the handle, the hydraulics will smoothly jack the vehicle up at .5in increments with each downward maneuver.  While in action, a black rubber body bumper shields the vehicle from risk of damage during the recovery. The easy-to-access red lowering lever ensures lowering the vehicle is achieved swiftly and safely thanks to the two-stage descent feature and safety stop. With the press of a lever, the user is able to adjust the lower speed between a slow or rapid descent.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Hyline's Canyon series stubby rear bumper is designed with the minimalist in mind that doesn't want to settle for the common bland styling of most stubby rear bumpers.  This is an extremely compact design that hugs the rear frame crossmember tightly but does NOT require any frame cutting.  It doesn't just look great; it's functional, easy to install and tough as nails. It's fabricated using USA Grade 3/16 Steel Plate, laser cut, CNC formed, robotically welded, and hand metal finished. The D-Ring mounts are 5/8" thick plate and are welded solid front and back so they can be used as recovery points. Our bumper allows you to use the factory or aftermarket hitch receiver, which could also be used as a center recovery point. All bumpers receive a thorough acid rinse, zinc phosphate rinse and cleaning, then are E-Coated and Powder Coated with light black texture. The textured powder coat matches the texture on the stock black fender flares almost perfectly. Completely Bolt on, No Drilling Necessary. PROUDLY MADE 100% In USA."]]></sales_desc>

Rest assured that our Engineers left any elements of subtlety on the cutting room floor when they developed the Armor Fenders. Aggressive lines and high wheel arches give the JK a whole new attitude that begs to be taken off-road. Sturdy all-steel construction with welded seams and a heavy textured black powder coat makes these fenders capable of absorbing abuse while delivering head-turning good looks. Front fenders are narrower than stock for greater clearance and feature stylized vents at the rear to aid in venting engine compartment heat. Rugged Ridge Armor Fenders are designed to work with factory components as well as the Rugged Ridge Spartan Grill, Hood Latches, Elite Fuel Doors, modular snorkel and even Rubicon Rock Rails. Installation uses the factory inner wheel liners or our Rugged Ridge All-Terrain Wheel Liners (11620.50), with minor trimming required.]]></sales_desc>

		<long_desc><![CDATA[Available in bare steel or aluminum;3 tapered flare;Made from 3/16" steel plate;Highline fender offers 3" of additional clearance;Mounting location for a 3/4" LED marker;<b>California Residents: <a href="/prop65" target="_blank">WARNING</a></b>"]]></long_desc>
		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Poison Spyder's DeFender XC's provide eXtreme Clearance for big tires without having to install a tall lift, maintaining a Low Center of Gravity (LCOG) and the performance benefits that come along with it. Like our standard DeFenders the XC's are constructed entirely of CNC laser cut, brake-formed 3/16 plate steel for strength and style that old school tube fenders just can't match. The DeFender XC's provide eXtreme Clearance! Like with the standard DeFenders, the back of the wheel opening is approximately 2" further back compared to typical tube fenders, and about 4" further back than the stock Jeep flares. But the wheel opening on the XC's is 3" higher than standard DeFenders, providing Massive Tire Clearance with minimal lift! While there are specific considerations to address with any particular Jeep, in most cases you should be able to run 37" tires with no suspension lift, and 40's with just couple inches of lift! The DeFender XC with 3" Tapered Flare was designed for maximum performance in several aspects. First, it provides the same splash protection of our regular 3" flare, keeping mud and debris from splashing up onto the side of the Jeep. But rather than having a straight side, the edge of the flare tapers inward toward the front of the Jeep, in a line parallel to the tapered edge of the hood. In this manner it tapers from 3" at the back, to about the same width as our "Zero Flare" at the front, providing the same great clearance for articulating tires and tight trails that our Zero Flare provides."]]></sales_desc>

Function is our foremost concern, with products that help rather than hinder your progress through the most extreme 4x4 trails and obstacles.

All of our products are 3-D CAD Designed and proudly Made in the U.S.A. All plate steel components are CNC Laser Cut and precision brake-formed. All tubular components are made of high quality American DOM tubing that is CNC laser notched and NC Bent. We invest the extra time and care to Trigger Weld all of our assemblies for deep, uniform weld penetration and beautiful, Motorsport Quality Welds. There are cheaper ways to manufacture parts, but anything less than the best materials and methods wouldn't be worthy of the Poison Spyder logo.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Trail-Gear's 9 Seal Housing Kit is machined from billet aluminum, has three o-rings on the outer surface of the seal housing, and has a double seal on the inside. The three outer o-rings keep the outer portion of the seal housing sealed up so that no fluid can leak or flow between the axle tube and the seal housing itself. The seal housing is tapered on the inside so that the axle shaft is lined up with the seal housing as it is installed to prevent damage to the seals or seal housing. The seal housing itself is secured in place with a set screw so that it cannot move or be pushed out of place when the axle shafts are installed. The inside of the seal housing has two seals installed to ensure that even while rock crawling on your side or racing at high speeds, no fluid leaks through or bypasses our seals. This will keep your fluid in your differential where it belongs, and not on your breaks and tires where it can create a dangerous situation.<br><br>The seals themselves are manufactured from a specially blended, high performance synthetic rubber that is so flexible that they can effectively seal any axle deflection, axle misalignment, or axle run out issues that may occur. The seal housing is shipped completely assembled with both seals installed, and replacement seals are also available, making the seal housing completely rebuildable. Our 9" seal housing will accommodate a 27 spline to a 35 spline axle shaft.<br><br>Seal housings are sold separately and two are needed to complete one axle housing. Seal housings are available for 3" and 3 1/2" tubing with either 1/4" or 3/8" wall thickness, and fit most of the popular aftermarket 9" axle housings being offered."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Trail-Gear understands when you have a link or even leaf sprung suspension, that during a vertical climb or decent, your suspension will unload making your truck less stable as the center of gravity becomes higher. Our answer to this problem is a small, easy to mount suspension winch that will allow you to stabilize your suspension and effectively control how much suspension droop you have during times when having that control makes all the difference.<br>Most competition buggies and hard core trail rigs have been using these suspension winches for years to get the job done, so Trail-Gear has decided to offer the Rock Recovery Suspension Winch 3000. It is compact, reliable, and easy to install. Everything about the Rock Recovery Suspension Winch 3000 is tailored so that installation is a snap.<br>The power cord is 57 long, so you can install this winch on the front or rear of your truck and have plenty of wire to reach the battery, the control is engineered so that it can be installed by attaching it to a piece of tubing, a shifter, or by using the bracket to fasten it to a switch panel.<br>The Rock Recovery Suspension Winch 3000 is shipped without winch line and can either be used with cable or synthetic winch line. We recommend 25' to 40' of 5/16" winch line for best performance."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Rock sliders are a great way of protecting the rocker panels of your Toyota. Trail-Gear has designed it?s Rock Sliders to be the strongest on the market, starting with 1 3/4 inch OD x .120 wall 1035 DOM. Trail-Gear Rock Sliders are the only rock sliders on the market that use 1035 DOM tubing, based on our testing we believe that using DOM tubing in this application makes our rock sliders the strongest, most affordable available today. Other companies try and cut manufacturing costs by using less expensive HREW tubing, but the end result is always the same, under extreme stress the HREW tubing splits down the seam, failing. Trail-Gear?s heavy duty design can take a pounding from the rocks while keeping body damage to a minimum, allowing you to slide over or between rocks on even the hardest trails without damage. Trail-Gear rock sliders are strong enough to hold the entire weight of the truck, a high-lift jack can be used anywhere along the slider for repositioning the rig on the trail, or simply high-lifting it up for repairs. The mounting legs are not welded onto the slider, but are shipped loose so that legs can be attached in different mounting positions. Mounting legs are pre-notched on one side and can be trimmed if needed on the opposite side. Mounting legs are 11 1/4 inch long, so they allow the sliders to stick out far enough to be used as a step if desired. Six mounting legs, three per side, are provided with the 58 inch and the 67 inch sliders, and eight mounting legs, four per side are provided with our 78 inch sliders. Trail-Gear rock sliders are sold in pairs, and are shipped raw with no finish, lightly oiled to prevent rusting.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Even with the roomiest of vehicles, packing the car for a long trip can quickly turn into a frustrating game of Tetris. CURT cargo carriers are a simple yet effective solution for maximizing the storage area of your vehicle. The advantage of a hitch-mounted cargo carrier is that it can be mounted on the rear or front end of a vehicle as long as the vehicle is properly equipped with the right receiver hitch. Mounting a cargo carrier in the front opens up the rear receiver hitch for towing a trailer or adding a second carrier or bike rack if needed. The hitch-mounted design also makes installation quick and easy.CURT introduces the mesh, bolt-together, tray-style cargo carrier. This carrier features a lightweight aluminum design to put less strain on your vehicle and resist rust and corrosion from outdoor exposure. It comes with a 2 x 2" shank and can hold up to 500 lbs. of cargo. This particular model also comes with a folding shank to allow the cargo carrier to be folded up when not in use. It offers a total storage area of 60" x 20".CURT tray-style cargo carriers are versatile and simple to use. They have holes along the outer edge for mounting a cargo net or bungees, making it easy to keep items secure, and they provide plenty of space to make your trip more comfortable, no matter where you are headed. Whether you prefer the hitch-mounted carrier or the roof rack option, CURT has cargo management solutions to meet your needs."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Even with the roomiest of vehicles, packing the car for a long trip can quickly turn into a frustrating game of Tetris. CURT cargo carriers are a simple yet effective solution for maximizing the storage area of your vehicle. The advantage of a hitch-mounted cargo carrier is that it can be mounted on the rear or front end of the vehicle as long as the vehicle is properly equipped with the right receiver hitch. Mounting a cargo carrier in the front opens up the rear receiver hitch for towing a trailer or adding a second carrier or bike rack if needed. The hitch-mounted design also makes installation quick and easy.CURT basket cargo carriers feature a strong bolt-together design and are made with heavy-duty carbide steel and a tubular construction for increased strength. One of the advantages of the basket style is its 6 high sides. These provide extra security and peace of mind during travel. This particular basket cargo carrier features a 1 1/4" x 1 1/4" shank with a 2" x 2" adapter sleeve to be able to fit most receiver-type trailer hitches. It can accept up 500 lbs. of cargo and has a durable black powder coat finish to resist rust, scratches and UV damage. Whether you prefer the hitch-mounted carrier or the roof rack option, CURT has cargo management solutions to meet your needs."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[1 body lift for 1987-2006 Jeep YJ and TJ Wranglers, as well as LJ Unlimiteds allows for additional tall tire clearance without exceeding practical suspension lift heights. The Currie billet aluminum body lift pucks are concave on the bottom side to allow the retention of the stock rubber body mounting pucks. This keeps the body isolated from the frame just like stock, so that no more noise or vibration will be transferred to the cab of the vehicle than would be stock. The aluminum pucks are powder coated black for durability, and all of the necessary new longer grade 8 body bolts are included in the kit. We highly recommend the use of the 1" raised heavy duty motor mount kit in conjunction with this body lift to keep all of your underhood and linkage pieces in line with the body where they belong. On a vehicle with a 4" lift and 33" tires, you can install the body lift and motor mount lift and efficiently clear 35" tires."]]></sales_desc>

These free moving weights sense this deflection and move opposite the heavy points to balance the entire assembly, wheels, tires, drums, hubs, even mud, snow or ice stuck to the wheels.]]></sales_desc>
