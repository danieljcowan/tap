This unique system allows the user to hold anywhere from a 20 inch down to the smallest 6 inch LED light bars and all at the precise and needed angle. Also it acts as a theft deterrent as it encloses the LED within a 12 gauge steel structure, yet provides a hi gloss mesh front for the LED light to shine through. However, if you want to change the look of the front, Aries offers additional face plates in brushed stainless and black carbon: open face plate. The Aries Pro Series is made from 1/4 inch plate and 1-1/2 inch OD cold rolled carbon steel and comes in a durable texture black powder coat finish. It is a solid once piece bolt on design, and does not require cutting or drilling. Whether you want to house your LED light bar, or you simply want the best grill guard on the market, the Aries Pro Series Grill Guard has you covered.]]></sales_desc>

Like the GEN II doors the hinge pins are bolt on, but now the latch plate is bolt on bracket as well. This allows us to add a horizontal adjustment feature on the latch location insuring proper alignment with the vehicle striker.  Another improvement is the door webbing. The fit of the webbing is improved and we added Velcro loops to secure the ends of the webbing so there is no more flapping. We encapsulated the arm pads in nylon material improving the life of the padding. We also improved the material of the webbing itself, heavy cordura nylon panels for comfort and durability.

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The Rugged Ridge Bed Mount Spare Tire Carrier answers that nagging question on the lips of proud Gladiator owners everywhere- what to do with that over-sized spare? While the factory spare is discretely tucked away under the JT's bed, outfitting your rig with 35 or larger tires will have you discovering the Gladiators departure angles to be comparable to an overloaded school bus. Bigger tires do get you over the big rocks, but your low-dangling spare will put an end to your fun in no time at all. Not to mention that lying flat on your back in the muck to access the spare for trail-side tire repair will have you questioning your position on the evolutionary chart. That's why mounting your oversize spare, conveniently & securely, in the truck bed can be a tremendous advantage for off-roaders and overlanders alike. <br><br>You'll find this pre-runner"-style Tire Carrier is not just striking in appearance, but engineered to deliver the goods with a hefty load capacity, handily hauling up to a 40-inch wheel & tire combo. Built from muscular 45mm diameter, 2.5mm-wall steel tubing and 5mm thick CNC cut & brake-formed steel plate, this carrier is rock-solid and designed to survive in harsh off-road conditions. The integrated wheel mount is adjustable to accommodate a variety of wheel offsets, while the carrier assembly installs to factory mounting locations for maximum strength & rigidity, with no drilling required. Rugged Ridge finished it off with a sleek satin black powder coat to protect from the elements and a limited 5-Year Warranty to protect from everything else, making the Rugged Ridge Bed Mount Tire Carrier a sensible choice for Gladiator owners."]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The RetraxONE retractable pickup bed cover is manufactured from polycarbonate, a durable thermoplastic commonly known as LEXAN. This low-profile design incorporates a front cover that is flush with the truck bed cover, which streamlines the overall appearance and provides a firm, dependable seal to help to keep the truck bed dry. This rigid, one-piece sheet is engineered to retract without joints or hinges that can trap dust, wear out or freeze. Polycarbonate has excellent impact resistance and is unharmed by sun, moisture or temperatures from -50 to +200?F. Sealed ball-bearing rollers mounted onto the aluminum support beams allow the RetraxONE truck bed cover to retract or close effortlessly without the use of springs or any kind of mechanism no moving parts to jam, freeze or fail. The compact storage canister, approximately 11 inches squared, contains a unique spiral track system that prevents the truck bed cover from coming into contact with itself as it opens or closes. Tempered aluminum support beams embedded into the polycarbonate sheet add strength to support heavy snow loads and ensure quiet, stable travel at any speed. In fact, the rigid design of the Retrax truck bed cover improves the aerodynamics of your pickup so much that it can improve your fuel economy by as much as 10%!]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Modifying JL flares for off-road is easy and the look is nothing short of heroic with the Rugged Ridge Fender Chop Bracket Kit. By removing the bulky factory fender light assembly, you'll have greater clearance for oversized tires with nothing to get between you and that next obstacle. Sturdy steel chop brackets install easily and lend support for the front of the factory fender flare, adding a fearless, aggressive new look. And since Jeeps don't live solely off-road, we've built-in bullet-style side marker and turn signal lights to ensure safe on-road operation too. Brackets come in pairs, for both Rubicon and Sahara models, and feature a matte black powder coat finish that blends seamlessly with the factory flare finish. All installation hardware and instructions are included for a hassle-free install in record time. Includes fender reinstall kit and 2 sets of LED lights.]]></sales_desc>

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[Fabtech?s cutting edge RTS? system has now been developed for the all new GM HD platform. The 6? RTS? utilizes a patent pending bracket system that keep the torsion bars raised up, in the stock location. This feature provides superior ground clearance at the frame as there are no torsion bars hanging down to become high centered on or damaged when offroading. The 6? RTS? system has been designed with unitized bracketry to retain the four front compression stops of the vehicle as GM intended. This distributes impact loads across a wide section of the frame rather than at a single point. High arched crossmembers and front differential skid plate are constructed of 1/4? thick steel to resist bending from hard front suspension impacts. Only 1/4? thick steel provides the rigidity and strength necessary to relocate the torsion bars, bump stops and lower control arms properly. Minimal heavy duty bracketry allow for a fast installation time with only two holes to drill and no cutting of the front diff housing. The 6?

		<sales_desc><![CDATA[The cooling system in your 2012-2018 Jeep Wrangler is one of the most crucial systems in the entire vehicle. If just one component in the cooling system fails or becomes clogged, it can be catastrophic. A clogged heater core is inconvenient on a chilly night's drive, but a clogged radiator can leave you out in the cold with a blown engine. <br><br>Unfortunately for many JK Wrangler owners, repeated clogging and replacement of cooling system components is an all too familiar scenario. Normal engine wear and servicing can introduce damaging solids into the cooling system, wreaking havoc as they go. 2012-2018 JKs are particularly susceptible, however, thanks to excess casting sand left in the cylinder heads from the factory. But Mishimoto is here to help clean up your JK's cooling system. <br><br>Their 2012-2018 Jeep Wrangler JK Coolant Filtration Kit will help keep anything that's not liquid coolant from circulating around your engine and cooling components. This direct-fit kit installs in under an hour and the included Wix filter traps particles as small as 27 microns. Their silicone hoses are a direct fit and the included ball valves make for a durable and long-lasting system. The 4mm-thick steel bracket can stand up to anything the street or trail can throw at it. <br><br>Like all Mishimoto products, the Mishimoto 2012-2018 Jeep Wrangler JK Coolant Filtration Kit is backed by Mishimoto Lifetime Warranty.]]></sales_desc>
